<p class="drop-cap">NEWS came from the army announcing brilliant
success. The valour of the King was specially
extolled; he was no longer a bashful, feeble prince,
victimised by feminine cabals, tyrannised over by
Richelieu. He had suddenly become a warrior,
foremost in danger, leading his troops in person
into the hottest of the fray. Each day his absence
lasted, and every fresh intelligence that arrived,
added to the excitement of Louise de Lafayette.
The danger to which he was exposed made her
tremble.</p>

<p class="i1">She eagerly desired his return, not for the mere
pleasure of seeing and conversing with him (though
that was very dear to her), but because she was sure
that the time had come when he would himself hold
the reins of government, and display all that nobleness
of character with which her romantic fancy had
invested him. Such, at least, was the conviction,
however delusive, of the pretty maid of honour,
who, lost in contemplation of the King's virtues,
failed to perceive the state of her own heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">At length the campaign terminated. Louis had
re-taken all the places conquered by the Spaniards.
They were in full retreat. The King returned to
Paris, which, not having been considered out of danger
from the attacks of the enemy, received him
with transports of joy. Mademoiselle de Lafayette,
a witness of the universal enthusiasm, saw in Louis
the worthy successor of Henry the Great, and the
inheritor of all his glory. Intoxicated by these
dreams, she imagined that even her advice would
be in future needless—that the King of his own
accord would suppress the arrogance of Richelieu,
and from henceforth exercise the royal authority
alone.</p>

<p class="i1">The following day, the Court being at the Louvre,
Louis visited the Queen at her lever. As he returned
into the anteroom, he approached Louise de
Lafayette. She was too much agitated even to
welcome him. That Louis was also greatly moved
was evident. The pallor that always overspread his
face when excited, was almost death-like, and every
feature worked convulsively. For some moments
they stood opposite to each other, without saying
a word. Then, overmastering his agitation, Louis
spoke to her in a low voice:—"I know not,
mademoiselle, when we shall be able to resume
those conversations which were so infinitely delightful—I
am overwhelmed with business." Then,
after glancing round, and seeing that every one had
retired, he seized her hand and kissed it tenderly.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah! so much the better," said Louise, beaming
with smiles. "May you, Sire, ever be thus occupied."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Do you want to banish me, then, just as I am
returned?" said he, retaining her hand in both of
his.</p>

<p class="i1">"No, Sire; but I want to see you reign."</p>

<p class="i1">"You have heard me blamed for my indolence?
I am sure you have. All I ask is, that you will wait
and judge for yourself. The Court is filled with my
enemies." He spoke with animation.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, I need not wait," replied the maid of honour
eagerly, her liquid eyes, full of faith and affection,
turned upon him, "I have long ago decided
in your favour."</p>

<p class="i1">"May you never change!" ejaculated Louis fervently.
"It would console me for a world of injustice.
I must now leave you," and he pressed her
hand again and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p class="i1">The eagerness with which Louis applied himself
to state affairs after his return, evoked much mirth
and ridicule among the ladies of the Court. Louise
de Lafayette was pained. When Madame de Sennécy
declared that his Majesty's industry could not
possibly last, she was offended in the highest degree.
The Cardinal, too, was openly abused for the military
appointments he had made during the war by
these fair critics, whereupon Louise, who dared not
openly defend the King, endeavoured to justify him
by exonerating the Cardinal. One morning, when
both King and minister had been bitterly attacked
in the anteroom, before the Queen had left her
apartments, Louise remarked to those around her
that the Cardinal, though unpopular, was undeniably
great; that he had founded the Académie Française,
rebuilt the Sorbonne, established the Royal

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Printing Press, founded the Jardin des Plantes,
and that, as a minister, he was brave, daring, and
wise.</p>

<p class="i1">These sentiments caused great surprise, for Mademoiselle
de Lafayette had hitherto by no means
spared Richelieu. The Duchesse de Sennécy openly
rebuked her for what she styled her "hypocrisy,"
and sent her in tears to her room. Her words, however,
were immediately reported to the Cardinal by
Chavigny, a gentleman of the bedchamber, who was
present, one of the many salaried Court spies in his
pay. Chavigny particularly dwelt upon the earnestness
of the maid of honour, and assured the Cardinal
that she could only have so expressed herself in
order to gain his favour.</p>

<p class="i1">No sooner had Chavigny left the Palais Royal
than the Comte de la Meilleraye, a distant relation
of Richelieu, requested an audience. La Meilleraye
was also in attendance on the King. He had come,
as he said, to ask a great favour of his all-powerful
cousin. Would the Cardinal assist him to a most
advantageous marriage with a lady to whom he was
devoted—Mademoiselle de Lafayette? From the
first moment he had seen her, he said, her beauty,
her elegance, her modest bearing and simplicity—qualities
so rare in the Court circle—had enchanted
him. Thus spoke the Comte de la Meilleraye.
Richelieu listened graciously. He liked by all legitimate
means to advance his family, and if the maid
of honour was his partisan, as Chavigny had reported,
nothing could be more expedient than such
a marriage. He promised therefore to consult the
King at once, and to endeavour to obtain his permission,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
warning La Meilleraye to do nothing in the
matter until he had heard again from him.</p>

  <img src="images/i-004.jpg"

  <div class="caption">THE PALAIS ROYAL, PARIS.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">The morning Council of State over, Richelieu accompanied
the King into his writing closet, to discuss
in private some important matters.</p>

<p class="i1">As the Queen's coterie had predicted, Louis soon
wearied of business; everything was now replaced, as
before, in the hands of the minister.</p>

<p class="i1">Louis leant back in his chair. He scarcely heard
the Cardinal's remarks.</p>

<p class="i1">From time to time, when specially appealed to,
he bowed his head in acquiescence. Then turning
away his eyes abstractedly towards the windows,
which faced the inner court, he anxiously watched
the driving clouds that scudded across the sky. He
had fixed a hunting-party at Rambouillet, and longed
to start as soon as the weather cleared, and Richelieu
had left him.</p>

<p class="i1">The mellow voice of the Cardinal, who, however
imperative in action, never startled his feeble master
by any outward display of vehemence, had continued
speaking for some time, in a monotonous tone, when
the King, seeing the sunshine appear, suddenly rose.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your eminence has, I imagine, done with me for
to-day," said he, looking eagerly towards the door.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, Sire; but there is still a trifling matter upon
which I would ask your decision."</p>

<p class="i1">"Pray mention it," replied Louis, tapping his boots
with a riding-whip he had taken off a table.</p>

<p class="i1">"My relative, the Comte de la Meilleraye, begs
your permission to marry."</p>

<p class="i1">"Willingly," replied Louis; "who is the fair lady,
Cardinal?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"It is Mademoiselle Louise de Lafayette, Sire,
maid of honour to the Queen."</p>

<p class="i1">If a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet, Louis could
not have been more overcome. He turned perfectly
livid, took a long breath, tottered backwards and sat
down again. The all-seeing eyes of the Cardinal were
fixed upon him; he did not speak, but watched his
master. Louis for some moments did not raise his
head; then he heaved a deep sigh, and with much
effort, in a strangely different voice, asked faintly—</p>

<p class="i1">"Does Mademoiselle de Lafayette herself desire
this marriage?"</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu had turned away, and affecting to be
busied with some books and papers lying on the
table, replied in an indifferent manner—</p>

<p class="i1">"As yet, Sire, we are unacquainted with the lady's
sentiments; but, as I am informed she has no other
attachment, I cannot but believe such an alliance as
that of my cousin will be acceptable to her."</p>

<p class="i1">The nervous spasm with which it was evident the
King had awaited this reply instantly relaxed. The
colour returned to his cheeks, his eyes brightened,
and he stood up—</p>

<p class="i1">"Before I can decide anything," said he, "I must
know Mademoiselle de Lafayette's feelings; acquaint
me with them speedily."</p>

<p class="i1">He spoke in a firm, decided way, very unusual
with him.</p>

<p class="i1">The Cardinal drew his own conclusions.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">By-and-by Chavigny informed Richelieu that
Mademoiselle de Lafayette had at once, and unhesitatingly,
refused the hand of the Count. Richelieu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
only smiled. "I knew it. The King, my good
Chavigny, is in love with her himself. She returns
it. They understand each other. Chavigny, I must
see this foolish girl, who ventures to mix herself up
with his Majesty. I must personally acquaint myself
with her feelings."</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Eminence will find it most difficult to
speak with her in private. The Duchesse de Sennécy
proposes giving a masked ball, at which her
Majesty and the Court will be present; would that
suit your plans?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Not at all," replied Richelieu. "When I speak
there must be no mask. I must study her countenance.
She is young and disingenuous. I shall
read her inmost thoughts. She has not been long
enough at Court to have learnt dissimulation. I
must see her before the King leaves Paris. We can
meet at my niece's, the Duchesse de Combalet."</p>

<p class="i1">"Mademoiselle de Lafayette could only feel
honoured by such a summons from your Eminence,"
replied Chavigny.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, I fancy she will accept the offers I shall
make her, unless she is an absolute idiot."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle de Lafayette was duly invited to a
<i>déjeûner</i> at the Palais Cardinal by the Duchesse de
Combalet, who received her alone. During breakfast
her hostess said everything that could flatter and
please her. She praised her dress and her appearance.
She was so simple, so unselfish, so different
from the other maids of honour, the Duchess said.
Then she went on to inform her that she knew the
Cardinal had the highest opinion of her; that he
had often expressed his admiration of her character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and her person to herself, the Duchess. "It is very
unusual with him, Mademoiselle, to speak to me
about the Queen's ladies; he is too much engrossed
with state affairs, too serious to notice them. But
you are an exception; you have made a deep
impression on my uncle."</p>

<p class="i1">Louise bowed, grew red and white by turns, and
listened in wondering silence.</p>

<p class="i1">Suddenly the door opened, and Cardinal Richelieu
appeared, followed by two favourite cats. Smiling
benignly, he received the maid of honour with great
condescension. Mademoiselle de Lafayette rose at
his entrance, and was about to withdraw, when he
took her hand and insisted on her reseating herself.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Combalet spoke with him on
general subjects, and constantly appealed to Louise
for her opinion. She gave it with her usual modest
frankness. Everything she said was applauded by
the Cardinal. He put forth all his powers to please
her.</p>

<p class="i1">In about half an hour a servant entered and
whispered to the Duchess. She affected great annoyance
at the interruption, and begged the Cardinal
and her guest to excuse her for a quarter of an
hour, while she gave some directions. "Besides,"
said she, and she turned with a meaning look to the
maid of honour, "I know that his Eminence wants
to have a little private conversation with you about
our cousin De la Meilleraye, whom you have so
cruelly refused. Poor man! he is in despair. I
shall return in a few minutes." Saying which she
kissed Mademoiselle de Lafayette on both cheeks,
and withdrew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu and the maid of honour were now
alone. The Cardinal was no longer the dissolute
prelate of other days, the adorer of two queens of
France, the slave of Madame de Chevreuse, the
lover of Marion de l'Orme. The life of labour he
led would have long ago killed any but a man of his
iron will and calm temperament. He never slept
more than three hours at a time, and literally worked
day and night. At eight o'clock in the morning he
was astir, ready to receive spies, generals, and ministers,
suppliants, and princes, who were already waiting
in the anteroom. He was as active as a Roman
senator, with a hundred clients assembled in his
portico. His cheeks were pinched and sunken; his
face sallow; his thin lips colourless; his brow, a network
of those fine wrinkles that come of excessive
thought. Even his eyes were dull, and half concealed
by his eyelids, though on occasions they
would still shoot forth sparks of fire. The straight
hair that lay upon his forehead, under his red <i>calotte</i>,
was scanty and almost white. Altogether, his appearance
was that of a man physically worn-out,
and indicative of his painful illness and somewhat
premature death. But the spirit of the man was
strong within him, and a consciousness of latent
power disclosed itself in every feature.</p>

<p class="i1">As he leant back in a spacious arm-chair, the two
cats nestled on his knees, he bent his half-closed
eyes upon Louise with almost feline cunning. Those
half-closed eyes alone betrayed his nature; otherwise,
his countenance expressed nothing but tranquil
enjoyment.</p>

<p class="i1">"Mademoiselle de Lafayette," he said in a soft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
musical voice that struck pleasantly upon the ear,
"I have both to reproach you and to thank you."
Louise looked at him with surprise. "Yes, I thank
you for the favour with which I hear you speak of
me; and I reproach you for having hitherto concealed
from me your good opinion. I am desirous
to see you become a member of my family. I hope
you will marry my cousin. But, believe me, the
ties of gratitude are stronger with me than those of
blood. Mademoiselle, I wish to be your friend."
Louise bowed her head with great respect, but felt
bewildered.</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu piqued himself on being a great physiognomist.
He had made a special study of the
human countenance. He saw that the face of Mademoiselle
de Lafayette was totally untroubled. Her
perfect self-possession astonished him. The phrase
he had uttered—"I wish to be your friend," solemn
words, indeed, from the mouth of Richelieu—had
caused in her no change of expression! Her composed
demeanour was, in the eyes of the Cardinal,
an additional reason for securing her as a partisan.
He had before much desired to gain her to himself,
but he now came to attach an immense importance
to success.</p>

<p class="i1">"I am very grateful for your Eminence's kind expressions,"
said Louise at last, with great modesty,
but with equal firmness; "but I do not wish to
marry. If the offer of your friendship involves any
sacrifice of my freedom, I must, with sorrow, decline
it. I seek nothing, your Eminence. I need no protection."
There was a quiet dignity in her words
and manner that took the Cardinal aback. He said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
nothing; but his eyes, now fully open and glistening,
rested on the maid of honour with surprise and displeasure.</p>

<p class="i1">Yet the real loftiness of soul she displayed, the
indifference with which she ignored his offers, appeared
to him so unaccountable that he could only
imagine she wished to extract from him some terms
more definite and decided. This idea gave him
courage to recommence the attack.</p>

<p class="i1">"Let us be frank," said he, smiling. "I know all."</p>

<p class="i1">"What do you mean, monseigneur?"</p>

<p class="i1">"The King loves you. The purity of his heart
and his high principles may allow you to confess it.
He loves you. And his interest, as well as your own,
requires that we should be friends."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle de Lafayette grew very pale; she
trembled, but did not for a moment lose her presence
of mind. "To what sort of friendship does your
Eminence allude?"</p>

<p class="i1">"An entire confidence on your part, and an active
acknowledgment on mine."</p>

<p class="i1">The Cardinal was on the point of promising her
titles, estates, and pensions; but Mademoiselle de
Lafayette, who, with downcast eyes, listened to him
in silence, all at once looked up fixedly into his face.
This look stopped him short.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Eminence," said she, "can only wish me
to give my personal confidence. In honour I could
promise no other. But I <i>have</i> no secrets, no concealments.
I am without ambition, I desire no favour.
Besides, I am sure that your Eminence will at once
understand me when I say—that, if ever it were the
pleasure of his Majesty to repose confidence in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
me—<i>there is no temptation, no power on earth</i>, that would
induce me to betray it." As she spoke, she looked
straight at the Cardinal. The colour returned to her
cheeks, and she sat erect—gentle, yet infinitely bold.</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu reddened, but he suppressed his rising
indignation. "The confidence of a great King," replied
he solemnly, a dark fire darting from his eyes,
"can only be properly accepted when the person to
whom it is addressed is capable of offering real assistance
to the sovereign. I propose, Mademoiselle
de Lafayette, to render you capable of imparting
such assistance. Whatever may be your natural
sense and penetration, this is an occasion in which
experience alone is valuable."</p>

<p class="i1">"But does not your Eminence think that rectitude
of purpose——"</p>

<p class="i1">"It is evident that you are little versed in the intrigues
of courts, mademoiselle," answered he loftily,
eying her with haughty disdain. "Perhaps some
day you will discover that the offer I have made you
of my esteem and assistance is not to be despised."</p>

<p class="i1">"No one can attach a higher value than I do to
the good opinion of your Eminence," interposed
Mademoiselle de Lafayette with warmth; "but I do
not think you have at all proved it in what you have
just said. Although I think I deserve it," she added
timidly.</p>

<p class="i1">The Cardinal contemplated her attentively for
some moments. His face was set, his eyes flashed,
and his hands which were clenched rested on his
knees. "I have only one word more to add," said
he in an angry voice. "Any idea of favour with the
King without my support is a delusion." He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
rapidly losing self-restraint. This girl had lashed
him into a fury. She saw it, but felt no fear.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Eminence, I think only of my duty," she
replied with firmness. "I fear no threats. I can
make no promise."</p>

<p class="i1">At these words the Cardinal rose. His face was
swollen with passion; a wicked fire gleamed in his
eyes; her coolness transported him beyond endurance.
"Once more, Mademoiselle de Lafayette,
remember what I say. My resolutions are unalterable;
I trample down everything. Without my
assistance, beware! Think of the future. Recall
the past. My enemies are rotting in their graves—my
friends rule France." Then, speaking more
calmly, he added, "You are too great a fool to
understand what you are doing. I can pardon your
presumption, however, because I know how to cure
it. Mademoiselle de Lafayette, you may withdraw."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">RICHELIEU, thoroughly exasperated, determined
to crush the girl who had dared to
brave him. He called to his aid his creature Chavigny.
Chavigny was intriguing, acute, and superficial;
an admirable tool—for he originated nothing.
Years ago he had sold himself to Richelieu, but as
he always went out of his way to abuse him, the
connection was not suspected. Under the direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of the Cardinal, he had entirely gained the King's
confidence. His easy good-nature encouraged the
shy Louis to tell him all his secrets, and to consult
him in all his difficulties.</p>

<p class="i1">Chavigny, who up to this time had attached little
importance to the King's inclination for the new
maid of honour, looking upon it simply as a passing
admiration for an attractive girl, too inexperienced
to take advantage of his favour, upon being questioned,
informed Richelieu that the King wrote to
her daily, and that she replied as often. Richelieu
at once resolved on his course of action. He would
in future see the correspondence himself. Each
letter was to be skilfully unsealed by his secretary,
Desmaret, and read, before it was delivered.</p>

<p class="i1">It was not possible for even the hard, stern Richelieu
to peruse these letters unmoved. He had been
once young and passionate himself. He could not
but appreciate the delicacy and eloquence with
which the King veiled his passion, and softened intense
love into the semblance of friendship. Nor
could he avoid feeling some admiration for the sweet
and simple nature that breathed in every line written
by the maid of honour. Both were evidently
ignorant of the ardour of their mutual attachment.
What was to be done? He must consult the King's
confessor.</p>

<p class="i1">Father Caussin, a Jesuit, had been only nine
months confessor to the King. He was learned,
conscientious, and guileless. Richelieu had selected
him for this important post in the belief that he
would assume no political influence over his royal
penitent. The General of the order had objected to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
his appointment on the same grounds. In person
Caussin was tall and spare. His long black cassock
hung about his thin figure in heavy folds. His face
was pale and emaciated. Yet a kindly smile played
about his mouth, and his black eyes beamed with
benevolence. Such was the ecclesiastic who seated
himself opposite to Richelieu.</p>

<p class="i1">"My father," said the Cardinal, saluting him
stiffly, and leaning forward and laying his hands on
some papers placed beside him on a table, as though
they related to what he was about to say.—"I have
summoned you on a very grave matter." Nothing
could be more solemn than the Cardinal's voice and
manner. The pleasant smile faded at once out of
the confessor's face. He became as grave, if not as
stern as the Cardinal, leant his head upon his bony
hand, and turned his eyes intently upon him. "Circumstances
have come to my knowledge," continued
Richelieu, "which, in my opinion, justify me in asking
you a very searching question." Caussin moved
uneasily, and in a somewhat troubled manner interrupted
him.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Eminence will not, I trust, desire to trench
upon the privacy of my office,—for in that case I
could not satisfy you."</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu waved his hand impatiently, placed one
knee over the other with great deliberation, and
leant back in his chair. "My father, I am surprised
at your insinuation. We are both Churchmen, and,
I presume, understand our respective duties. The
question that I would ask is one to which you may
freely reply. Does it appear to you that his Majesty
has of late shown indifference in his spiritual duties?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Caussin drew a long breath, and, though relieved,
was evidently unwilling to answer.</p>

<p class="i1">"Pardon me, my father," again spoke the Cardinal,
a slight tone of asperity perceptible in his mellow
voice, "I ask you this question entirely in the
interest of the holy order to which you belong.
Many benefices have fallen vacant lately, and it is
possible,—it is <i>possible</i>, I repeat, that I may advise
his Majesty to fill up some of them from the ranks
of the Company of Jesus." His half-closed eyes
rested significantly on Father Caussin as he said
these words.</p>

<p class="i1">Caussin listened unmoved. "There are, doubtless,"
said he, "many members of our order who
would do honor to your selection, Cardinal. For
myself, I should want no preferment;—indeed, I
should decline it." He spoke with the frankness of
perfect sincerity.</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu looked down, and worked the points of
his fingers impatiently on the table. His hands
were singularly white and shapely, with taper fingers.
As a young man he had loved to display them; the
habit had remained with him when he was thoughtful
or annoyed. "Well, my father," said he, "your
answer?"</p>

<p class="i1">Caussin eyed the Cardinal suspiciously,—"I am
happy to reassure your Eminence; his Majesty is, as
usual, in the most pious sentiments."</p>

<p class="i1">"Hum!—that is strange, very strange; I fear that
the benevolence of your nature, my father—" Caussin
drew himself up, and a look as much approaching
defiance as it was possible for him to assume passed
into his pleasant face. Richelieu did not finish the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
offensive sentence. "It is strange," he went on to
say, "for I have reason to <i>know</i>—I ask you for no
information, reverend father—that his Majesty's
feelings are engaged in a mundane passion which, if
encouraged, may lead him from those precepts and
exercises in which he has hitherto lived in obedience
to the Church."</p>

<p class="i1">"To what passion do you allude?" asked Caussin
cautiously.</p>

<p class="i1">"To the infatuation his Majesty evinces for the
new maid of honour, Louise de Lafayette. The
lady is self-willed and romantic. She may lead him
into deadly sin."</p>

<p class="i1">Caussin started. "I apprehend nothing of the
kind," replied he drily.</p>

<p class="i1">"True, my father, but that is a matter of opinion.
I think differently. Absolution, after repentance,"
continued the Cardinal pompously, "may wash out
even crime, but it is for us,—you, his Majesty's confessor,
and I, his minister, both faithful servants of
the Holy Father,"—Caussin looked hard at the Cardinal,
who was by no means considered orthodox at
Rome,—"it is for us to guard him from even the
semblance of evil. I have sent for you, my father,
to assist me in placing Louise de Lafayette in a convent.
It will be at least a measure of precaution. I
shall require all your help, my father; will you give
it me?" Richelieu, as he asked this important
question, narrowly observed Caussin from under his
drooping eyelids. The confessor was evidently embarrassed.
His kindly countenance was troubled;
and he was some time in answering.</p>

<p class="i1">"To dedicate a young and pure soul to God," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
replied, at length, with evident hesitation, "is truly
an acceptable work; but has your Eminence considered
that the lady in question is of the most
blameless life, and that by her example and influence
his Majesty may be kept in that path of obedience
and faith which some other attachment might not
insure?" As he asked this question Caussin leaned
forwards towards Richelieu, speaking earnestly.</p>

<p class="i1">"Father Caussin," said the Cardinal, in his hardest
manner, and motioning with his hand as though commanding
special attention, "we must look in this
matter beyond his Majesty's feelings. I have good
reason for alarm. A crisis is impending," and he
turned again to the papers lying on the table with a
significant air. "If Louise de Lafayette has any
vocation, let her be advised to encourage it. Consider
in what manner you can best bend the King's
will to comply. You tell me the lady is a good
Catholic; I rejoice to hear it. She comes of a family
of heretics. She may be sincere, though I much
doubt it. At all events, she must be removed; simply
as a matter of precaution, my father, I repeat,
she must be removed. Let me beg you to consult
the General of your order upon this matter immediately.
Understand me, I am advising this simply as
a matter of precaution, nothing more." All this
time Caussin had listened intently to the Cardinal.
The troubled look on his face had deepened into
one of infinite sadness. His brow was knit, but
there were doubt and hesitation in his manner.</p>

<p class="i1">"I can only consent to assist your Eminence," he
replied, in a low voice, after some moments of deep
thought, "on the condition that the lady herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
freely consents. I can permit no violence to be done
to her inclinations, nor to the will of his Majesty. If
the lady is ready to offer up herself to the Church
through my means, it will doubtless redound to the
credit of our order; but she shall not be forced."</p>

<p class="i1">"Certainly not, certainly not," interposed Richelieu,
in a much more affable tone. "I do not know
why your reverence should start such a supposition."</p>

<p class="i1">"I will consult our General, Cardinal," continued
Caussin; "but I am bound to say that the influence
the lady has hitherto exercised has been most legitimate,
most orthodox, altogether in favour of our
order, to which she is devoted, and of the Church.
She is a most pious lady."</p>

<p class="i1">"All the more fit for the privilege I propose to
bestow upon her," answered Richelieu, with unction;
"she will be safe from temptation within the bosom
of the Church, a blessing we, my father," and Richelieu
affected to heave a deep sigh, and cast up his
eyes to heaven, "we, who live in the world, cannot
attain. We act then in concert, my father," he
added quickly, in his usual manner, "we act for the
good of his Majesty's soul?"</p>

<p class="i1">Caussin bowed acquiescence, but mistrust and
perplexity were written upon every line of his honest
face, as he observed the evident satisfaction evinced
by the Cardinal at his compliance.</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu rose: "We will force no one's inclination,
my father," he said blandly, "but all possibility
of scandal must be removed. You must at once
prepare his Majesty. It will be a good work, and
will greatly recommend you to your order." Caussin,
with a look of the deepest concern, bowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
profoundly and withdrew. When he was alone, the
Cardinal re-seated himself and fell into a deep muse.
"Now," said he, at length, speaking to himself,
"her fate is sealed. I will take care that her vocation
shall be perfect. This presumptuous girl shall
soon come to rejoice, ay, rejoice, that she is permitted
to take refuge in a convent. As for Caussin,
he is a fool. I must remove him immediately."</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu, as he said of himself, never halted in
his resolves. Caussin was shortly sent off by a <i>lettre
de cachet</i> to Rennes, narrowly escaping an intimation
from the Cardinal to his Superior that it would be
well to exercise his devotion to the order as a
missionary in Canada.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-t.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Court had removed from the Louvre to
Saint-Germain, always the favourite abode of
the melancholy monarch.</p>

<p class="i1">Louis suffered tortures from the galling restraints
his position entailed upon him in his intercourse
with Mademoiselle de Lafayette. He rarely saw her
alone. When he addressed her, he was conscious
that every eye was fixed upon them. Their correspondence,
carried on by means of Chavigny, was,
he felt, full of danger. His only comforter in his
manifold troubles was this same treacherous Chavigny.
Prompted by the Cardinal, Chavigny urged
the King, on every possible occasion, to make some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
arrangement with Mademoiselle de Lafayette to
meet in private. "If she loves you," said this unworthy
tool, "if you really possess her heart, she
will long to meet your Majesty with greater freedom
as much as you can do. It is for you to make some
such proposal to her. Do it, Sire; do it without
delay, or I assure you the lady will think you careless
and indifferent." Thus spoke Chavigny. Louis
listened, meditated on what he said, and was convinced.
He gave himself up to the most entrancing
day-dreams.</p>

<p class="i1">The season was summer. The weather was hot,
and the tall windows of the great saloon were thrown
open. The Court had gathered round the Queen,
who was engaged in a lively conversation with
Mademoiselle de Montpensier, the young daughter
of the Duc d'Orléans. Seeing that her services were
not required, Louise de Lafayette, pensive and
silent, stole away to the balcony outside the windows.
She stood alone, lost in her own thoughts.
With noiseless steps Louis approached her. He
lent by her side over the balustrade, bending his
eyes on the broad plains towards Paris.</p>

<p class="i1">"You are thoughtful, Sire," said Louise timidly.
"Will you tell me your thoughts?"</p>

<p class="i1">"If I do," replied Louis, casting a fond glance
upon her, "will you trust me with yours?"</p>

<p class="i1">A delicious tremor passed through her whole
frame. She cast down her large grey eyes, and
smiled. "Indeed I trust you, Sire," she murmured
softly; "you know I do."</p>

<p class="i1">"But trust me more,—let our communion be more
intimate. A brother's love is not more pure than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
mine," whispered the King; "but," and he hesitated
and blushed, "I have never enjoyed the privilege
of a brother." Louise raised her eyes inquiringly.</p>

<p class="i1">The King was greatly confused. "A brother—"
and he stopped. Then, seeing her earnest look
of curiosity—"A brother," he repeated, "salutes his
sister: I have never enjoyed that privilege, Louise."
He was scarcely audible. "Let my self-denial, at
least, secure me all your confidence."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Sire, you have it, entire and unreserved;
you know it. I might distrust myself, but you, Sire,
never, never!"</p>

<p class="i1">"How happy you make me!" returned the King,
and a sickly smile overspread his haggard face. "I
understand—I appreciate your attachment to me;
but oh, mademoiselle, how can my feeble words
express mine to you?—how can I describe that which
is without bounds—without limit? You can live
without me. You can find solace in your own
perfection, in the admiration of those around you—but
I, I am nothing without you. I am a mere
blank—a blot upon a luxurious Court—an offence
to my superb wife. No one cares for my happiness—not
even for my existence, but you. When I
cannot approach you, I am overcome by despair.
Oh, Louise, give yourself up to me, in pity—without
fear, without restraint. Let me see you every day,—let
me be encouraged by your words, led by your
counsels, soothed by your pity, blessed by your
sight. You say you do not doubt me. What then
do you fear?"</p>

<p class="i1">The maid of honour looked at him with tearful
eyes. His earnestness, his desolation, his entreaties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
melted her heart. His unconscious love made her
pulses beat as quickly as his own.</p>

<p class="i1">"You know that I am devoted to you,—what
more can I say?" she whispered softly.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have a favour to ask you," said Louis anxiously,—"a
favour so great I hesitate to name it." He was
greatly agitated. At this moment the passionate
love he felt animated him with new life, and lent a
charm to his countenance it had never borne before.</p>

<p class="i1">"A favour, Sire?—it is granted before you speak.
How is it that you have concealed it from me?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Then I am satisfied,"—the King heaved a sigh
of relief,—"what I ask depends entirely on you.
You will grant it."</p>

<p class="i1">"Am I to promise?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, only give me your word; that is enough."</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, I give you my word; from the bottom of
my heart, I give you my word. Tell me what it is
you desire." And she raised her face towards the
King, who contemplated her with silent rapture.</p>

<p class="i1">"Not now,—not now," murmured he, in a faltering
voice; "I dare not; it would require too long an
explanation,—we might be interrupted," and he
turned and glanced at the scene behind him,—at
Anne of Austria, blazing with diamonds, radiant
with regal beauty, her silvery laugh surmounting the
hum of conversation. He saw the brilliant crowd
that thronged around her where she sat. Great
princes, illustrious ministers, historic nobles, chivalric
soldiers, grave diplomatists, stately matrons, ministers
of state, her ladies in waiting, and the five
other maids of honour, in the glory of golden youth.
He saw the dazzling lights, the fluttering feathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the gorgeous robes, the sparkling jewels, standing
out from the painted walls,—all the glamour of a
luxurious Court. Then he gazed at the sweet face
of the lonely girl whose loving eyes were bent upon
him awaiting his reply,—his soul sank within him.</p>

<p class="i1">"Would to God I were not King of France," he
exclaimed abruptly, following the tenor of his
thoughts. Then, seeing her wonder at his sudden
outburst, he added, "The favour I ask of you shall
be made known to you in writing. This evening
you shall receive a letter from me; but,"—and he
drew closer to her and spoke almost fiercely,—"remember
you have pledged yourself to me—you cannot,
you dare not withdraw your word. If you do,"—and
an agonised look came into his face,—"you will
drive me to madness." Saying these words, he suddenly
disappeared. She was again left standing alone
on the balcony.</p>

<p class="i1">Louise de Lafayette was startled, but not alarmed.
The notion that the King was capable of making any
indecorous proposition to her never for a moment
occurred to her; at the same time she felt the utmost
curiosity to know what this secret might be. She
formed a thousand different conjectures, each further
than the other from the truth. On entering her
room at night, she found a letter from the King.
She hastily tore it open and read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="i1">"I have long adored you, and you only. During
the whole time you have been at Court, I have been
able but twice to address you alone, and to chance
only did I even then owe that inexpressible privilege.
It is impossible for me to endure this restraint any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
longer. If you feel as I do, you will not desire it.
I have therefore commanded that my hunting-lodge
at Versailles should be arranged as much as possible
in accordance with your taste. There is a garden
laid out, filled with the flowers you love; there are
secluded lawns; there is the boundless forest. Above
all, there is freedom. Come then, my Louise, and
share with me this rural retreat—come where we can
meet, unrestrained by the formalities of my Court.
Bring with you any friend you please. At Versailles
I hope to spend part of every week in your company.
My happiness will be perfect; you will find me the
most grateful of men. You will have nothing to fear.
Do you dream calumny? Who would dare to attack
a lady as pure as yourself? May I not claim
your consent when I rely on your promise to grant
whatever I ask? I feel that you cannot deny me, for
you have repeated a thousand times that you trust my
principles. You cannot doubt my honour. To refuse
me would only be to insult me. Surely Louise, you
would not do that! It would wound me to the very
soul. It would destroy every hope of my future life.</p>

<p class="ar">
"(Signed) <span class="sc">Louis</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p class="i1">When Mademoiselle de Lafayette read this artful
letter, which had been composed by Chavigny under
the direction of Richelieu, and copied out by the
King, she was utterly confounded. The fatal veil
which had so long concealed the truth fell from her
eyes. Even to a girl pure and simple as herself, all
further delusion was impossible. This letter and the
feelings that dictated it were not to be misunderstood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Merciful heavens!" cried she, clasping her hands,
"with what a tone of authority, with what assurance,
he proposes to dishonour me! This, then, is the
attachment I believed to be so pure! What! does
he, the husband of the Queen of France, suppose
that I would encourage a guilty passion! Wretch
that I am! Instead of helping him, I have led him
into sin! I had no right to engross his thoughts. He
is already estranged from his wife, and I have severed
them still further! O God! what will the Queen
think of me? How can I atone for this horrible sin?
I must—I will—reconcile them. Then God may
forgive my involuntary crime!"</p>

<p class="i1">Again and again, with tears streaming down her
cheeks, she read and re-read the letter. She pressed
the paper to her lips. The next moment she dashed
it on the floor in an agony of remorse.</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, how can I reply?" sobbed she. "What can
I say to temper the blow which must sever us? He
will be in despair—he will die. But my reputation,
my honour—his own—his duty to the Queen! No,
I will never consent to such degradation—my soul
revolts at the thought! How gladly would I sacrifice
my life for him, but I cannot commit a sin. I
must leave the palace, I must go—Whither?"</p>

</div>

<p class="i1">As she listened to the echo of her own words, an
unformed thought suddenly darted into her mind.
Go—yes, she would go where none could follow.
Youth, beauty, wealth, the sacrifice should be complete.
She would prove, even in separation, how
great had been her love. "<i>There is no other way</i>,"
she said, speaking aloud, and an angelic smile lit up
her face. She cast herself upon her knees, and prayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
in peace. Her prayer finished, she took up her pen
and replied thus to the King:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="i1">"Your Majesty desires that we should no longer
meet in the presence of witnesses. Before knowing
what was required of me, I promised to comply. I
will not withdraw my word; but I entreat of your
Majesty the liberty of myself selecting the place
where these private interviews are to be held. When
I have received your Majesty's assent, I will inform
you where this place is to be. In eight days' time I
shall be prepared to receive you. Your Majesty can
then judge of the extent of my confidence, and of
the unbounded devotion I feel towards you.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEXT morning, as soon as it was light, Louise
sent for the King's confessor. She showed
him the King's letter, and confided to him her resolution.
Caussin listened in silence; but the kindly old
man, priest though he was, could not restrain his
tears—so touching was her innocence, so heartfelt her
sorrow. He understood the simple goodness of her
heart; he trembled at the sacrifice she was imposing
on herself; but he could not combat her arguments.
He promised, therefore, to assist in making the needful
arrangements, and he pledged himself to support
the King in the trial awaiting him.</p>

<p class="i1">The coach was in waiting which was to bear her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to her future home. All at once she recollected she
had still one final sacrifice to make. The letters of
the King, which she always carried about her, were
still intact within the silken cover in which she preserved
them. She drew these letters from her bosom
and gazed on them in silent agony. Her eyes were
blinded by tears. She dared not read them again,
for she knew they would but increase her grief. As
she held them in her hand, remorse at what she had
done preponderated over every feeling. Thus to
have enthralled a husband belonging to another—her
sovereign and her mistress—came suddenly before
her in its true light. She felt she had forgotten her
duty. Once more she kissed the crumpled leaves
over which her fingers had so often passed; she
deluged them with her tears. Then she lit a taper
and set fire to the whole.</p>

<p class="i1">She sat immovable before the burning fragments;
her eyes fixed, her hands clasped. As the flame
rose, glistened, and then melted away into light
particles of dust that the morning air, blowing in
from the open window, bore away fluttering in the
breeze, she seemed to look upon the death of her
love. "Alas!" cried she, "now all is over." Vows
of eternal constancy, entreaties that would melt a
heart of stone, confidence beyond all limit, affection
that enshrouded her in folds of unutterable tenderness—gone,—vanished
into air! Such was the image
of her life: a life bright in promise, gay and dazzling,
to smoulder down into ashes, too fragile even to
claim a resting-place.</p>

<p class="i1">Louise de Lafayette wrote a few lines to the
Duchesse de Sennécy, praying her to convey her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
dutiful salutations to her Majesty, and to request
her dismissal from the post of maid of honour,
which, she said, "she felt she had fulfilled so ill."
Then she addressed the following note to the King:—"I
request your Majesty to meet me this day
week, at noon, in the parlour of the Convent of the
Daughters of Mary, in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine."</p>

<p class="i1">When the King read these lines his heart sank
within him. The austerity of the place, a rendezvous
in a convent of peculiar sanctity, where he knew
Mademoiselle de Lafayette always resorted at the
solemn season of Lent and Passion Week, where he
could only converse with her between double bars,
was not the place of meeting of which he had fondly
dreamed! Yet his natural delicacy made him fully
appreciate the modesty of Louise and the gentle
rebuke she administered to him for his too pressing
solicitation in naming a place of meeting. At the
convent, although they would certainly be alone, no
scandal could possibly attach to the interview.
More than this he never for an instant imagined.
The habits of piety in which Mademoiselle de Lafayette
lived, and her frequent retreats for religious
purposes, raised in his mind no suspicion. He should
see her, and see her alone, undisturbed, unwatched.
On that thought he dwelt with rapture; time would,
he hoped, do the rest.</p>

<p class="i1">Punctually, at noon, the King arrived at the Convent
of the Daughters of Mary. He was received
by the Abbess in person, and conducted into the
parlour. Here she left him. A moment more, a
curtain was withdrawn, and, behind double bars of
iron, Louise de Lafayette stood before him. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
wore the dark brown robes and corded girdle of the
order, the long white veil of the noviciate falling
round her lovely face. The King stood transfixed,
his eyes riveted upon her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Forgive me, Sire," said she, in a voice full of
sweetness, "forgive me for having dared to dispose
of myself without your leave. But, Sire, a too fervent
attachment had led us both into danger. I
had forgotten my duty in the love I felt for you,—your
Majesty forgot you were a husband. That
letter, in which you proposed meeting me at Versailles,
opened my eyes to the truth. God be
thanked, there was yet time for repentance. This
morning I have taken the white veil, and in a year I
shall pronounce the final vows. My life will still be
passed with you, Sire; but it will be a life of prayer."
As she spoke she smiled sadly, and awaited his reply.</p>

<p class="i1">"Great God!" exclaimed Louis at length, when
he could find words. "Is this a vision? Are you an
angel already glorified?" He sank upon his knees
before her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Rise, Sire," said she solemnly; "such a posture
befits neither the dignity of your station nor the
sacredness of mine. I am no angel, but still your
tender friend; a friend who watches over you, who
only lives to remind you of your duties. You will
share my heart with the holy virgins among whom I
live, the saints in heaven, and my God. Let not
even the tomb divide us—live, Sire, such a life that
we may be reunited among the spirits of the just."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Louise!" exclaimed Louis, in a voice choked
with emotion; "Louise, who alone fills my despairing,
my solitary heart! at your feet I abjure all profane,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
all unholy thoughts. Speak—command me!
my spirit follows you. But, alas!" and he rose to
his feet and wrung his hands in bitterest anguish,
"what is to become of me in the midst of my
detestable Court? Suffer me to follow your example;
let me too, within the walls of a cloister,
seek that resignation and courage which make you
so sublime."</p>

<p class="i1">"Good heavens, Sire!" exclaimed Louise de Lafayette,
"what do I hear? You, a sovereign, a husband,
bury yourself in a cloister! Our situations are
utterly unlike. I, a solitary girl, have but withdrawn
from a world to which you were my only tie. Your
glory, the glory of France, your own welfare, and the
welfare of the Queen, are to you sacred duties. And
now, Sire, listen to me," and she approached close to
the bars which divided them, and a look of the old
melting tenderness passed for a moment over her
beautiful face, "Sire, if ever I have been dear to you,
listen. The sin for which I feel most poignant sorrow—the
sin which years, nay, a life of expiation cannot
wipe out—is—that I have by my selfish, my miserable
attachment, alienated you from the Queen."
Louis was about to interrupt her, but she signed to
him to be silent. "I know, Sire, what you would
say," she broke in hastily,—"that our attachment
has in no way altered your relations towards her
Majesty. True, it is so; but my influence over you
ought to have been devoted to unite you. It ought
to have been my privilege to render both your
Majesties happy as man and wife, to give heirs to
France, to strengthen the Government. Alas, alas!
I have sinned almost beyond forgiveness!" and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
awhile she broke into passionate sobs, which all her
self-command could not restrain. "Her Majesty,
Sire, is a most noble lady, beautiful, generous, loyal,
courageous. For twenty years she, the greatest queen
in Europe, has been neglected, almost scorned by
you her husband. Under these trials her lofty spirit
has not flinched—she has been true to you and to herself.
Temptation, provocation, nay, insults have not
shaken her virtue. Believe nothing against her, Sire—her
soul is as lovely as her body. Sire, the Queen
is childless, devote your whole life to her and to
France; tend her, protect her, love her. Then, and
then only, shall I be reconciled to God." As she
spoke her sweet grey eyes turned towards heaven,
her countenance was transfigured as in an ecstasy;
no saint standing within a sculptured shrine could
be more pure, more holy.</p>

<p class="i1">The King gazed at her awestruck. "Dispose of
me as you will," murmured he; "command my life—but,
remember that now I have lost you, happiness
is gone from me for ever!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Adieu, Sire," said Mademoiselle de Lafayette.
"The hour-glass warns me that our interview is over.
Return in six months and tell that I have been
obeyed."</p>

<p class="i1">She drew the dark curtain across the bars, and
the Abbess entered. Louis returned hastily to Saint-Germain.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the broad valley of the Loire, between Tours
and Saumur, the train stops at the small station
of Cinq-Mars. This station lies beside the Loire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
which glides by in a current so broad and majestic,
as to suggest a series of huge lakes, with banks
bordered by sand and scrub, rather than a river. On
either side of the Loire run ranges of low hills, their
glassy surface gashed and scored by many a rent
revealing the chalky soil beneath, their summits
fringed with scanty underwood, and dotted with
groups of gnarled and knotted oaks and ragged fir-trees,
the rough roots clasping cairns of rock and
blocks of limestone. In the dimples of these low
hills lie snugly sheltered villas, each within its own
garden and policy. These villas thicken as the small
township of Cinq-Mars is approached,—a nest of
bright little houses, gay streets, and tall chimneys
telling of provincial commerce, all clustered beneath
chalky cliffs which rise abruptly behind, rent by
many a dark fissure and blackened watercourse.
Aloft, on a grassy marge, where many an old tree
bends its scathed trunk to the prevailing wind,
among bushes and piled-up heaps of stones, rise the
ruins of a feudal castle. Two gate towers support
an arch, through which the blue sky peeps, and
some low, broken walls, without form and void,
skirt the summit of the cliff. This ruin, absolutely
pathetic in its desolate loneliness, is all that remains
of the ancestral castle of the Cöiffiers de Cinq-Mars,
Marquis d'Effiat. From this hearth and from these
shattered walls, now raised "<i>to the height of infamy</i>,"
sprung that handsome, shallow, ambitious
coxcomb, known as the Marquis de Cinq-Mars, who
succeeded Mademoiselle de Lafayette in the favour
of Louis XIII.</p>

<p class="i1">Deprived of Louise de Lafayette, the King's spirits
languished. In spite of his partial reconciliation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
with Anne of Austria, and the birth of a son, he was
sullen and gloomy, spoke to no one, and desired no
one to speak to him. When etiquette required his
presence in the Queen's apartments, he seated himself
in a corner, yawned, and fell asleep. The internal
malady of which he died had already undermined
his always feeble frame. His condition was altogether
so critical, that the Cardinal looked round
for a companion to solace his weariness. Henri de
Cinq-Mars had lately come up to Paris from Touraine.
In years he was a boy, under twenty. He
was gentle, adroit, and amusing, but weak, and the
Cardinal believed he had found in him the facile
instrument he sought.</p>

<p class="i1">Cinq-Mars was presented to the King. Louis was
at once prepossessed by his handsome person and
distinguished manners. Cinq-Mars, accustomed from
infancy to field sports and country life, angling in
the deep currents of the Loire and the Indre, hunting
wild boars and deer in the dense forests of Azay
and of Chanteloup, or flying his gear-falcon from the
summits of his native downs, struck a sympathetic
chord in the sad King's heart. One honour after
the other was heaped upon him; finally he was made
Grand Seneschal of France and Master of the Horse.
From this time he dropped the patronymic of
"Cinq-Mars," and was known at Court as "Monsieur
le Grand," one of the greatest personages in France.
For a time all went smoothly. King and minister
smiled upon the petulant stripling, whose witty
sallies and boyish audacity were tempered by the
highest breeding. He was always present when the
Cardinal conferred with the King, and from the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
gave his opinion with much more freedom than altogether
pleased the minister, who simply intended him
for a puppet, not for an adviser. When the Cardinal
remonstrated, Cinq-Mars shook his scented curls,
pulled his lace ruffles, talked of loyalty and gratitude
to the King, and of personal independence, in a
manner the Cardinal deemed highly unbecoming and
inconvenient. Monsieur le Grand cared little for
what the Cardinal thought, and did not take the
trouble to hide this opinion. He cared neither for
the terrible minister nor for the eccentric Louis,
whom he often treated, even in public, with contempt.
It was the old story. Confident in favour,
arrogant in power, he made enemies every day.</p>

<p class="i1">Monsieur le Grand, however, passed his time with
tolerable ease when relieved of the King's company,
specially in the house of Marion de l'Orme, Rue des
Tournelles. He was presented to her by Saint-Evrémond,
and fell at once a victim to her wiles. Marion
was the Aspasia of the day, and the charm of her
<i>entourage</i> was delightful to him after the restraints
of a dull and formal Court. Here he met D'Ablancourt,
La Chambre, and Calprenéde, the popular
writers of the age. The Abbé de Gondi and Scarron
came also, and even the prudish Mademoiselle de
Scudéri did not disdain to be present at these <i>Noctes
Ambrosianæ</i>. Marion de l'Orme, then only thirty,
was in the zenith of her beauty. Her languishing
dark eyes exercised an absolute fascination over
Cinq-Mars from the first instant they met. Her
affected reserve, the refinement of her manners, the
<i>entrain</i> of her society, free without license, captivated
him. He believed her to be virtuous, and desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
to make her his wife. Marion de l'Orme was
to become <i>Madame le Grande</i>!</p>

<p class="i1">This was precisely what that astute lady had
angled for. Hence her reserve, her downcast eyes,
her affected indifference. She saw that she was
dealing with a vain, ignorant boy, who, in her hands,
was helpless as an infant. Truly, he was madly in
love with her, but he was a minor, and under the
guardianship of the Dowager Marquise de Cinq-Mars,
his mother, who might possibly not view an
alliance with Mademoiselle Marion de l'Orme as an
honour to the ancestral tree of the Effiats de Cinq-Mars.
The marriage must be secret. Early one
morning they started from the Rue de Tournelles in
a coach and never stopped until they had reached
the old castle among the hills of Touraine, above
the feudatory village of Cinq-Mars. In the chapel
of that now ruined pile their faith was plighted.
Marion promised love, Cinq-Mars constancy. They
were incapable of either. For eight days the old
castle rang with the sounds of revelry. Cinq-Mars
and Marion were as in a fairy palace; life was but a
long enchantment. But at the end of that time
Nemesis appeared in the shape of the Dowager Marchioness,
to whose ears the report of these merry-makings
came at Paris. Cinq-Mars replied to his
mother that it was all a <i>passetemps</i>, and that Mademoiselle
de l'Orme—well—was still Mademoiselle de
l'Orme; that he loved the Principessa Maria di Gonzaga
(to whom the handsome profligate had, indeed,
paid his addresses before leaving Paris, the better to
throw dust in the eyes of the world), and that he should
shortly return to Paris and his duty with his Majesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The mediæval chatelaine, however, was not to be
deceived. She knew of the secret marriage, and
nothing could exceed her rage. That Marion de
l'Orme should sit on the feudal dais upon the seigneurial
throne—that she should wear her jewelled
coronet, should eat out of her silver dish, and inhabit
her apartments—the thing was atrocious, scandalous,
impossible. She flew to the Cardinal, with whom
she had some friendship, and informed him of what
had occurred. The Cardinal, who had formerly
favoured Marion de l'Orme with more than his
regard, was as much incensed as herself. That his
<i>protégé</i>, Cinq-Mars, should supplant him, made him,
old as he was, furiously jealous. That Cinq-Mars
should dare to abandon the splendid position he
himself had assigned him, leave the morbid Louis a
prey to any adventurous scoundrel whose adroit
flattery or affected sympathy might in a few hours
render him arbiter of the Court and master of the
kingdom, was, to Richelieu's thinking, an unpardonable
crime. The artful prelate immediately took
his measures. A royal ordinance was speedily
framed, making all marriages contracted by persons
under age, and without the consent of guardians,
null and void!</p>

    <span class="smaller">FROM A PAINTING BY LENAIN.</span></div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Cinq-Mars returned to Court indignant, insolent,
defiant; swearing vengeance against the meddling
Cardinal, and ready to enter into any scheme for
his destruction. Mademoiselle Marion de l'Orme
re-opened her salon in the Rue des Tournelles.</p>

<p class="i1">As for Louis, from whom the knowledge of this
little escapade had been carefully concealed, he
received back the truant with greater favour than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
ever. Cinq-Mars, confident in the King's attachment,
and looking on him as too feeble to combat
his own audacious projects, spoke words which
Louis had not heard since the beloved voice of
Louise de Lafayette had uttered them. "He ought
to rid himself of the Cardinal, and rule for himself,"
said Monsieur le Grand; "if not by fair, then by
foul means." "<i>Let Richelieu die</i>," cried Cinq-Mars,
"as he has made others die—the best blood in
France: Montmorenci, Chalais, Saint-Preuil, Marillac,
and so many others." It is certain that the
King listened to these proposals favourably. He
actually consented to conspire against himself and
the State which he governed. Louis was too stupid
to realise the absurdity of his position. He permitted
Cinq-Mars to coquet with the Spanish
Government, in order to insure the support of
Spanish troops to be sent from the Netherlands to
defend Sedan against the Cardinal and his own
army in case of failure. But Richelieu, now fully
alive to the dangerous ascendancy of Cinq-Mars,—for
he had spies everywhere, specially the soft-spoken
Chavigny, who was always about the King,—openly
taxed his Sovereign with treachery in a
message borne to him by the Marquis de Mortémart.
Louis was dumbfounded and terrified. He
wrote a letter that very same day, addressed to
the Chancellor Séguier, apologising for his seeming
infidelity to his minister. "He did not deny," said
he, "that Monsieur le Grand desired to compass the
Cardinal's death," but, with incredible meanness, he
added, "that he had never listened to him." Monsieur
le Grand, whose weak head was by this time completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
turned, fully believing himself invincible,
openly discussed what he should do when he was
himself prime minister. Suspecting Louis of being
too weak to be his only supporter, he turned to
Gaston, Duc d'Orléans. Monsieur, whose life, like
that of his brother's, singularly repeats itself, bethinking
himself of early times and of a certain
moonlight meeting on the terrace of Saint-Germain,
at once addressed himself to the Queen. But she
had already suffered too much to allow herself again
to be drawn into danger. When Monsieur detailed
the plot, and asked her significantly, "What news
she had lately had from her brother, the King of
Spain?" she answered that she had had no news,
and instantly changed the conversation. This did
not at all cool Monsieur's ardour, such as it was.
Three times he had been banished from France for
treason, and three times he had returned, as ready
as ever, with or without the Queen, to conspire,
to betray, and to be again banished. So the traitor-prince
and the vainglorious favourite, both intensely
hating Richelieu, laid their heads together to destroy
him by means of Spain. To them was joined the
Marquis de Thou, one of the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> of the
Court, along with Fontrailles, secretary to Monsieur.
The great Cardinal, sitting in the Palais Royal like
a huge spider in his web, ready to pounce upon his
prey as soon as it had reached the precise spot
where he intended to seize it, was familiar with
every detail. Monsieur was to receive four hundred
thousand crowns in order to raise levies in France;
he was also to declare war against France in concert
with Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The Cardinal was to be assassinated or imprisoned
for life; Gaston was to be proclaimed regent for his
nephew Louis XIV. It was the old story, only, now
an heir was born to the throne, Monsieur did not
dare to claim the first place. Fontrailles, a creature
of his own, he allowed to be sent into Spain. The
treaty was signed at Madrid by Fontrailles, on the
part of Monsieur and Cinq-Mars, and by the King
of Spain on his own part. This done, Fontrailles
flew back to France, with the precious document
stitched in his clothes. Scarcely was the ink dry,
before Richelieu was provided with a copy.</p>

<p class="i1">The Court was at Narbonne, on the Mediterranean,
whither Cinq-Mars had led the King, in order to be
near the Spanish frontier. Richelieu was at this
time greatly indisposed, and in partial disgrace. He
hung about the Rhone, sometimes at Tarascon, near
Avignon, sometimes at Valence, conveniently near
to be informed by Chavigny of everything that
happened. Chavigny, deep in Louis's confidence,
pendulated between the King and the minister. At
the fitting moment, Chavigny requested a formal
audience. It was the afternoon of the same day
that Fontrailles had returned to Narbonne, the
treaty with Spain still stitched in his clothes. Contrary
to custom, when Chavigny knocked at the
King's door, Louis requested Monsieur le Grand to
retire. This alone ought to have aroused his suspicions.
While Chavigny talked with the King, Cinq-Mars,
ashamed of letting the Court see his exclusion
from the room, lolled in the anteroom reading a
story. Fontrailles found him there.</p>

<p class="i1">"How now, Monsieur le Grand," said he, "do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
allow his most Christian Majesty to give an audience
at which you are not present? You are getting him
into bad habits."</p>

<p class="i1">"It is only Chavigny," replied Cinq-Mars, not
taking his eyes off his book; "he can have nothing
particular to say, for he is here every day. I am
weary of the King's company. I have been with him
all day, and I want to finish this story, which is much
more interesting than his stupid talk." And Cinq-Mars
threw himself back in his easy-chair, and
resumed his reading.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, Monsieur le Grand," said Fontrailles, smiling
at him curiously, "fortune favours you. You are a
beautiful man. Look at me, with my hump" (Fontrailles
was deformed); "I use my eyes; I am going
to-night to meet Monsieur, before I leave Narbonne.
I have brought him that little present from Madrid
you know of. I have it safe here in my pocket,"
and Fontrailles tapped his side and grinned. "Come
with me, Monsieur le Grand," said he, coaxingly,
and he tried to take his hand, but Cinq-Mars repulsed
him. "Come with me; believe me, the air of Narbonne
is heavy at this time of year. I am not sure
that it is not deadly, very deadly, indeed—especially
for you, Monsieur le Marquis. A little change will
do your health good. I am going. Come with me
where we can breathe"; and Fontrailles laughed a
short dry laugh, and looked out of the window upon
the blue expanse of ocean, whose waves beat against
the yellow shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="i1">"I pray you, Fontrailles, do not trouble me," said
Cinq-Mars, looking up over his book and yawning.
"I really must have some time to myself, or I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
die. Besides, I want to see his Majesty when Chavigny
goes; he is staying longer than usual, I think."</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, Monsieur le Grand, too long for a man
coming from the Cardinal, methinks."</p>

<p class="i1">Fontrailles still stood watching Cinq-Mars. His
deep-set eyes were fixed upon him intently, as Cinq-Mars,
with perfect indifference, went on reading his
story. Fontrailles passed his hand thoughtfully
over his brow two or three times. A look of pity
came into his face as he contemplated Cinq-Mars,
still reading. He was so young, so fresh, so magnificent;
his golden locks long and abundant; his
pleasant face faultless in feature; his delicate hands;
his perfumed clothes,—all so perfect! Should he
try to save him? A tear gathered in the eye of the
hardened conspirator.</p>

<p class="i1">"Monsieur le Grand," said he softly, stepping up
nearer to Cinq-Mars and placing his hand on his red
and silver shoulder-knot—"Monsieur le Grand, I
say——"</p>

<p class="i1">"What, Fontrailles, are you not gone yet? <i>Ma
foi!</i> I thought you were far on your road to Monsieur——"</p>

<p class="i1">"No, Monsieur le Grand; no, I am not gone yet."</p>

<p class="i1">Cinq-Mars put down his book, sat upright, and
looked at him.</p>

<p class="i1">"What the devil do you want with me, Fontrailles?
I will meet you and Monsieur le Duc to-morrow.
For to-night, peace."</p>

<p class="i1">"Have you no suspicion of what Chavigny is
saying to the King all this time, Marquis?" asked
Fontrailles with an ominous grin.</p>

<p class="i1">"None, my friend; but I shall hear it all before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
his <i>coucher</i>. His most gracious Majesty is incapable
of lying down to rest before telling me every
syllable," and Cinq-Mars snapped his finger and
thumb contemptuously towards the door of the
room within which Louis was closeted with Chavigny.</p>

<p class="i1">"Are you quite sure of the King, Monsieur le
Grand?" asked Fontrailles significantly, still leaning
over Cinq-Mars and pressing his hand upon his
shoulder-knot. "It is needful for you to be quite
sure of him. His Majesty is apt to be weak and
treacherous."</p>

<p class="i1">Cinq-Mars nodded his head; then, as if something
had suddenly struck him, he rose, and in his turn
began to gaze curiously at Fontrailles, whose manner
and countenance were strangely expressive of some
unspoken fear.</p>

<p class="i1">"You are very tall, Monsieur le Grand," said Fontrailles
abruptly, speaking low, with his hand placed
over his eyes, the better to contemplate Cinq-Mars,
now drawn up to his full height, and staring at
him with wonder; "you are very tall," he repeated,
"and I am such a little man. You are very handsome,
too—the handsomest gentleman in all France—and
very gracious to me also—very kind and
gracious."</p>

<p class="i1">Fontrailles spoke thoughtfully, as a man who
turned some important matter over in his mind.</p>

<p class="i1">"Have you come here only to tell me this, Fontrailles?"
answered Cinq-Mars, laughing, and again
he yawned, passed his jewelled fingers through his
clustering locks, and again took up the book which
he had laid down on a table beside him, and reseated
himself. Fontrailles, however, had never taken his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
eyes off him. His gaze had deepened into an expression
of deep sorrow, although he spoke jestingly.
Whatever train of thought occupied him, it had not
been broken by what Cinq-Mars had just said.</p>

<p class="i1">"You are very tall," he again repeated, as if speaking
to himself, in a peculiar voice; "so tall, indeed,
that you could do without your head, Monsieur le
Grand, and yet be taller than I am. Perhaps this
makes you careless. I am short, and I could not
afford to lose my head—so—I am going to leave
Narbonne instantly. The air here is as deadly to
my constitution as it is to yours. Marquis, pray do
believe me. Will you come with me—the tall man
with the little one?—both needing a change. Will
you come?"</p>

<p class="i1">Cinq-Mars did not heed him a whit. Fontrailles
laid his hand heavily on the thick shock of Monsieur
le Grand's golden curls.</p>

<p class="i1">"No, <i>mille diables</i>, no!" roared Cinq-Mars in a
rage, shaking him off; "I will not go. Why should
I go? For God's sake leave me. I am just at the
catastrophe of my story, and you keep on tormenting
me like a gadfly."</p>

<p class="i1">"Excuse me, Monsieur le Grand," replied Fontrailles
submissively, "I did but advise you for your
good. I desire your company for the sake of that
comely head of yours; but, as I said, you are tall,
and I am short, which makes a great difference. It
is a long journey across the mountains of France
into the Low Countries," added he, sighing. "That
will be my road—a long and weary road. It might
fatigue your excellency. I am going, Monsieur le
Marquis. I am gone—Adieu!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Cinq-Mars did not look up, and Fontrailles, turning
upon him a last look full of pity, disappeared.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Chavigny left the King, Cinq-Mars
entered the royal chamber. Louis was
silent, absorbed, and melancholy—would answer no
questions, and abruptly dismissed the favourite on
the plea that he was fatigued and needed rest.</p>

<p class="i1">Monsieur le Grand was naturally surprised at the
change. The significant words of Fontrailles recurred
to him; too late he repented his careless
indifference to the friendly warning. But after all,
if the King failed him, there was Monsieur and there
was the treaty. What had he, Cinq-Mars, to fear
when the King's brother had so deeply compromised
himself? The Cardinal, too, was ill—very ill; he
might die. Still, as he turned to his own suite of
apartments his mind misgave him. The King had
not told him one word of his interview with
Chavigny; and although Chavigny would have
denied it upon oath on the consecrated wafer, Cinq-Mars
knew he was the Cardinal's creature and his
go-between with the King.</p>

<p class="i1">When Cinq-Mars reached his rooms he found a
letter from his friend, De Thou. "Fly," said this
letter—"fly instantly. I have certain intelligence
that the Cardinal is acquainted with every particular
of the treaty signed at Madrid. For myself I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
nothing to fear; but you have incurred the deadly
hatred of Richelieu."</p>

<p class="i1">Thereupon Cinq-Mars, hurriedly disguised himself
in a Spanish cloak, with a sombrero hat slouched
over his face, stole out of the prefecture where the
King was staying, and made his way as fast as he
could run to the city gates. They were closed.
Then, fully aroused to the urgency of his position,
the strange words of Fontrailles ringing in his ears,
he sought out the abode of an humble friend, whom
he had recommended to serve the Court with mules
for the journeying to the south from Paris—a man
of Touraine, whom he had known from his boyhood.
He roused him from sleep—for the night had now
closed in—and acquainted him with his danger.
The faithful muleteer did his best. He hid him
under some loose hay with the mules in the stable.
It was in vain. Cinq-Mars had been seen and
tracked from the prefecture to the muleteer's house,
and the scented exquisite—whose word a few hours
before ruled the destiny of France—was dragged
out headlong from the hay, his fine clothes torn and
soiled, his face scratched and bleeding, amid the
hooting of the populace and the jeers of his enemies.</p>

<p class="i1">De Thou, his friend, was arrested on the same
day, not as guilty of conspiring, but simply as being
cognisant of the existence of the treaty of Madrid,
which Fontrailles had carefully carried off into the
Netherlands stitched in his clothes, a copy of which
lay with the Cardinal.</p>

<p class="i1">Monsieur Duc d'Orléans was also, for the fourth
time, arrested and imprisoned.</p>

<p class="i1">The effect of that copy of the treaty which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Chavigny had shown to the King, while Cinq-Mars
read his story, was instantaneous. Louis became
greatly alarmed. He understood that Richelieu
knew all, and therefore must be fully aware that he
had himself encouraged and approved a plot to kill
him. The same day that Cinq-Mars was conducted
a prisoner to the Castle of Montpellier, Louis insisted
upon going himself to Tarascon, to make a
personal apology to Richelieu. He was already so
weakened by the disease of which he died, that he
was forced to be carried in a chair into the Cardinal's
lodgings. They were together many hours. What
passed no one knew, but it is certain that the
"<i>amiable criminal</i>," as Cinq-Mars is called by contemporary
authors, was the scapegoat sacrificed to
the offended dignity of the Cardinal; that Monsieur,
the King's only brother, was to be tried for treason;
and that Richelieu should be restored to the King's
confidence. In his eagerness to propitiate his offended
minister, Louis actually proposed to take his
two sons from the custody of the Queen and place
them with the Cardinal, in order to guarantee his
personal safety. This abject proposition was declined
by Richelieu, who was unwilling to provoke
the Queen's active hostility at so critical a moment.</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu had conquered, but he was dying.
Though his body was broken by disease, his mind
was vigorous as ever; in revenge and hatred, in
courage and fortitude, his spirit was still lusty. In
his enormous thirst of blood, none had ever excited
him like the airy Marquis de Cinq-Mars,—a creature
of his own, whom he had raised to the dizzy height
of supreme power, to become his rival in love and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
power. The great minister felt he had made a
mistake: it angered him. He had not patience to
think that he should have been taken in by a butterfly,
whose painted wings he had decorated with his
own hands. He, the all-potent Cardinal, the ruler
of France, circumvented by a boy! He swore a big
oath that not only should Cinq-Mars die, but that
death should be made doubly bitter to him.</p>

<p class="i1">Richelieu was now at Valence on the Rhone.
How was he to reach Lyons, where the trial was to
take place? The distance is considerable. His limbs
were cramped and useless, his body racked by
horrible pain. But go he would; if he died upon
the road he would go. So he ordered a room of
wooden planks to be constructed, gilt and painted
like a coach, and lined with crimson damask. This
room contained a bed, a table, and a chair. Within
reclined the Cardinal. Too ill to bear the motion of
a carriage, he was borne on the heads of twenty of
his body-guard by land. Houses, walls, and gate-ways,
were knocked down to make way for him.
By water he was conveyed in a towing boat pulled
up the Rhone against the current by horses to Lyons.
Attached to this boat was another, in which the
prisoners Cinq-Mars and De Thou were carried. So
Richelieu passed onwards, with all the pomp of a
Roman pro-consul conducting barbarian princes
first to adorn his triumph, then to die! As for
Monsieur, he had already made his peace with his
brother and Richelieu. He turned King's evidence,
and betrayed everybody. Fontrailles, who alone
could have convicted him, was safe across the frontier.
"Talk not to me of my brother," even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
besotted Louis exclaimed, when he heard that Monsieur
was again at liberty; "Gaston ever was, and
ever will be, a traitor."</p>

<p class="i1">The only crime which even the ingenuity of Richelieu
could prove against Cinq-Mars was that he had
joined with Monsieur in a treaty with Spain. Now
the original transcript of this treaty was lost, Fontrailles
having carried it with him into the Netherlands,
stitched in his pocket. If Monsieur the Duc
d'Orléans, therefore, had declined to speak, Cinq-Mars
and his friend De Thou must have been
acquitted. But Monsieur, on the contrary, loudly
demanded to be interrogated on his own complicity
and on the complicity of Cinq-Mars. The Cardinal
had already showed what was in his mind, by giving
orders, as soon as he was lifted out of his portable
chamber, on arriving at Lyons, and before the trial
had begun, "for the executioner to hold himself in
readiness."</p>

<p class="i1">The trial was on the 12th of September, 1642.
It began at seven o'clock in the morning, at the
Hôtel de Ville. The Chancellor Séguier, a personal
enemy of Monsieur le Grand, who had affronted him
in the days of his greatness, was the president, and
Monsieur Duc d'Orléans the principal witness.
Monsieur's evidence was given with touching candour.
He was so careful to tell all the truth, so
skilful in bringing out all those facts which were
calculated to place Cinq-Mars in the most odious
light, that the charges were easily proved to the
satisfaction of the judges. The trial was over in a
few hours. Then the two young men were summoned
before the judges in the council-chamber to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
hear their sentence. It was read out to them by
Monsieur de Palleruc, a member of the criminal
court of Lyons. According to this sentence they
were both to be beheaded; Cinq-Mars was to be
tortured. He listened with calmness, De Thou with
resignation. They both shook hands with their
judges. "I am prepared to die," said Cinq-Mars to
Séguier, the Chancellor, "but I must say the idea
of torture is horrible and degrading. It is a most
extraordinary sentence for a man of my rank and of
my age. I thought the laws did not permit it.
Indeed, I do not fear death, gentlemen," continued
the poor lad, turning to the judges, "but I confess
my weakness,—I dread torture. At least, I beseech
you, let me have a confessor."</p>

<p class="i1">His request was complied with, and Father Malavette,
a Jesuit, was brought into the council-chamber.
As soon as he saw him Cinq-Mars ran forward and
embraced him. "My father, they are going to torture
me," he cried; "I can scarcely bring myself to
bear it! What is your opinion?"</p>

<p class="i1">"That you must submit to the hand of God,
Monseigneur. Nothing happens but by his permission."</p>

<p class="i1">Cinq-Mars bowed his handsome head, covered
with the sunny curls, and was silent. From the
council-chamber he was led by Monsieur de Lanbardemont,
an officer of the Court, to the torture-room.
Here he remained about half an hour, and
suffered torture, both ordinary and extraordinary.
His supple limbs and delicate skin were horribly
lacerated. He was unable to walk when he came
out, and was supported by the officials. "Let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
now think of my soul," he said faintly; "send my
confessor to me, and permit me to be alone with
him." This wish was granted, and an hour passed,
during which he confessed and received absolution.
Then he said to Father Malavette, "I have not
eaten for twenty-four hours, my father, and I am
very weak. I fear if I do not take something I may
swoon upon the scaffold, though indeed, I assure
you, I do not fear to die." A little wine and bread
were brought to him, of which he partook. "Ah!
my father," said the poor boy of twenty-two, "what
a world it is! Everybody I know has forsaken me.
How strange it is! I thought I had many friends,
but I see no one cares for me now but poor De
Thou, whom I alone have brought to this pass."</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas! my son, you are young, or you would not
wonder at this," answered Father Malavette sorrowfully;
"'put not your faith in princes.' What says
Ovid too, who, like you, enjoyed the favour of
Augustus, and was then cruelly punished?</p>

<p class="ac smaller">
"'Donec eris felix, multos numerabis amicos.'"
</p>

<p class="i1">"But, my father, when I was the favourite of his
Majesty, I tried to serve my friends in every way I
possibly could, yet now I am alone."</p>

<p class="i1">"No matter," said the priest, shaking his head,
"your service to them only made them your
enemies."</p>

<p class="i1">"Alack, I fear it is so," replied Cinq-Mars, sighing
deeply. Then he asked for paper, and wrote to his
mother. He prayed her to pay all his debts,
and again expressed his utter astonishment at the
conduct of his friends. At three o'clock in the afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
both he and De Thou were carried in a hired
coach into the Place des Terraux, lying over against
the banks of the river Soane, in the outskirts of the
city. Here the scaffold was erected. Every house
in the Place was covered by temporary balustrades
and balconies; the roofs also were crowded with
spectators. Thousands had come together to see
the favourite die.</p>

<p class="i1">Cinq-Mars with difficulty mounted the ladder leading
to the scaffold, with the help of Father Malavette.
Then, still holding him by the hand to steady his
wounded limbs, he raised his plumed hat from off
his head, and, with a graceful air, saluted the multitude.
He turned to every side, and passed around
to each face of the platform, so that all might see
him and receive his salutation. He wore a court
suit of fine Holland broadcloth, trimmed with gold
lace; his black hat ornamented with red feathers was
turned back in the Spanish style. He had high-heeled
shoes with diamond buckles, and green silk
stockings, and he carried a large scarlet mantle, to
cover his body after decapitation, neatly folded on
one arm. His fair young face was perfectly serene,
and his clustering curls, slightly powdered, were
scented and tended as carefully as heretofore. Having
bowed to the crowd, he replaced his hat
on his head, and, with his hand resting on his
right side, he turned round to look about him.
Behind were two blocks, covered with red cloth.
Beside them stood the executioner. He was only
a city porter—the regular official being ill—a coarse
and brutal fellow, with bloated face, wearing the
dress of a labourer. When he came up to Cinq-Mars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
with scissors to cut off his hair, M. le Grand
put him away with a motion of disgust. He begged
Father Malavette to do him this office, and to
keep his hair for his mother. While the long ringlets
which fell over his shoulders were being cut off,
Cinq-Mars turned towards the executioner, who had
not yet taken the axe out of a dirty bag which lay
beside him, and asked him haughtily, "What he was
about?" and "Why he did not begin?" The rude
fellow making a wry face in reply, Cinq-Mars frowned,
and addressed himself to Father Malavette. "My
father," said he, "assist me in my prayers, then I
shall be ready."</p>

<p class="i1">After he had prayed very devoutly, and kissed the
crucifix repeatedly, he rose from his knees, and again
in a firm voice repeated, "I am ready, begin!"
Then he added, "May God have mercy upon me,
and forgive my sins." He threw away his hat, unloosed
the lace ruff about his throat, put back his
hair from his face, and laid his head on the block.
Several blows descended ere his head was severed
from the body; the executioner being unready and
new to his office. When the head fell it gave a
bound, turned itself a little on one side, and the lips
palpitated visibly, the eyes being wide open. The
body was covered with the scarlet mantle borne by
Cinq-Mars on his arm for that purpose, and carried
away to be buried.</p>

<p class="i1">The King, informed by the Cardinal of the precise
day and hour when Cinq-Mars would suffer death,—for
every detail had been virtually arranged before
Richelieu left Valence in his wooden chamber,—took
out his watch at the appointed time, and, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
most perfect unconcern, remarked to Chavigny, "At
this moment Monsieur le Grand is making an ugly
face at Lyons."</p>

<p class="i1">Then Richelieu ordered that the feudal castle of
Cinq-Mars, in the valley of the Loire, should be
blown up, and the towers razed "<i>to the height of
infamy</i>."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the Louvre was a walled and turreted
stronghold, with moat and drawbridge, bastion
and tower, lying on grassy banks beside the
river Seine, then unbordered by quays and untraversed
by stone bridges, an ancient castle, strongly
fortified, stood in the open country, hard by, without
the city walls. In the time of Charles VI., the mad
king, husband of the notorious Isabeau de Bavière,
this castle belonged to Bernard Comte d'Armagnac,
Constable of France, the ally of the English against
his own sovereign, and a leader in those terrible civil
wars that desolated France throughout the space of
two reigns. Hither the English and the Burgundians
often repaired, to meditate some murderous
<i>coup de main</i> upon the capital, to mass their bloodthirsty
troops for secret expeditions, or to seek a
safe retreat when the fortune of war was adverse. As
time went by this castle grew grey with age; the
rebel nobles to whom it belonged were laid in their
graves; no one cared to inhabit a gloomy fortress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
torn and battered by war and sacked by marauders.
The wind howled through the desolate chambers,
owls hooted from the rents in its turrets, and noisome
reptiles crawled in the rank weeds which choked up
its courts. It came to be a gruesome place, lying
among barren fields, where the ruffians and desperadoes
of the city resorted to plan a murder or to hide
from justice. This God-forgotten ruin and the foot-trodden
fields about it were purchased at last by
wealthy nobles, who loved the fresh country breezes
beyond the new streets which now arose on this side
of the river. The materials of the old castle served
to furnish walls for the palaces of the Rambouillets
and the Mercœurs, historic names in every age of the
national annals. Here they kept their state, until
Cardinal Richelieu, either by fair means or foul, it
mattered little to him, bought and destroyed their
spacious mansions, pulled down all that remained of
the castle walls, filled up the ditches, levelled the
earth, and, on the ill-omened spot, raised the sumptuous
pile known as the Palais Cardinal, near, yet
removed from, the residence of the sovereign at the
Louvre. The principal buildings ran round an immense
central square, or courtyard, planted symmetrically
with trees and adorned with fountains and
statues. From this central square four other smaller
courts opened out towards each point of the compass.
There was a chapel splendidly decorated, and,
to balance that, two theatres, one sufficiently spacious
to hold three thousand spectators, painted on
panel by Philippe de Champagne. There were ballrooms
furnished with a luxury unknown before;
boudoirs—or rather bowers—miracles of taste and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
elegance; galleries filled with pictures and works of
art, and countless suites of rooms, in which every
decoration and adornment then practised were displayed.
Over the grand entrance in the Rue Saint-Honoré
appeared, carved in marble, the arms of
Richelieu, surmounted by a cardinal's hat and the
inscription "Palais Cardinal." Spacious gardens extended
at the rear.</p>

<p class="i1">Still the Cardinal, like Wolsey at Hampton Court,
added wall to wall of the already overgrown palace,
and bought up street after street within the city to
extend the gardens, until even the subservient Louis
showed some tokens of displeasure. Then, and not
till then, did the Cardinal cease building. At his
death he presented his palace to the sovereign; and
from that day to this the Palais Cardinal, now Palais
Royal, has become an appanage of the State.</p>

<p class="i1">Before us stands the Palais Cardinal—solitary, in
the midst of lonely gardens, sheltered by waving
groves. The greensward is divided by straight walks,
bordered by clipped lime-trees, rounded at intervals
into niches for statues and trophies; balustraded terraces
border deep canals, and fountains bubble up
under formal groups of yew or cypress. The palace
casts deep shadows on the grass. It is very still.
High walls encircle the enclosure. The very birds
are mute. Not the bay of a hound is heard. Moss
gathers on the paths and among the tangled shrubberies,
and no flowers catch the radiance of the sunshine.
Within is the great, the terrible Cardinal.
The ground is sacred to the despot of France, the
ruler of the monarch, the glance of whose eye is death
or fortune. Journeying direct from Lyons in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
chamber on wheels—after the execution of Cinq-Mars—to
Fontainebleau, where he rested, he is come
here to die. Yonder he lies on a bed of state, hung
with embroidered velvet in a painted chamber, the
walls covered with rare pictures and choicest tapestry,
the windows looking towards the garden. The
moment approaches when he will have to answer for
his merciless exercise of absolute power over king
and people, to that Heavenly Master whose priest
and servant he professes to be. How will he justify
his bitter hatred, his arrogant oppression of the great
princes and nobles of France? How will he meet
the avenging ghosts of the chivalrous Montmorenci,
the poetic Chalais, the gallant Cinq-Mars, the witty
Saint-Preuil, the enthusiastic Urbain Grandier, in the
unknown country whither he is fast hastening? Who
tried to seduce, then to ruin, the Queen, Anne of
Austria, and send her back, divorced and disgraced,
into Spain? Who turned the feeble Louis into a
servile agent of his ambition, and exercised over his
weak mind a tyranny as shameful to himself as degrading
to the sovereign? True, Richelieu may
plead reasons of State, a rebellious nobility, traitorous
princes, and an imbecile king; but the isolation of
the throne, begun under his rule, was both barbarous
and impolitic, as after ages showed. True, he possessed
rare genius, and his life was industriously devoted
to what he called "<i>the glory of France</i>"; but
it was a mean and selfish glory, to attain which he
had waded through the noblest blood of the land.</p>

<p class="i1">Look at him now—he has just received extreme
unction. A hypocrite to the last, he folds his hands
on his breast and exclaims—"This is my God; as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
his visible presence, I declare I have sacrificed myself
to France." When he is asked by the officiating
priest—"If he forgives his enemies?"—he replies,
"I have no enemies but those of the State." Now
the hand of death is visibly upon him. In a loose
robe of purple silk, he lies supported by pillows of
fine lace. He is hardly recognisable, so great have
been his sufferings, so complete is his weakness; his
bloodless lips pant for breath, his hollow eyes wander
on vacancy, his thin fingers work convulsively on the
sheets, as though striving against the approach of
invisible foes.</p>

<p class="i1">But, before he departs, a signal honour is reserved
for him. Behold, the rich velvet curtains, heavy
with golden embroideries, are held aside by pages
who carry plumed hats in their hands, and Louis
XIII. enters hastily. He is bareheaded, and is accompanied
by the princes of the blood and the great
ministers of State. Louis is so shrunken and attenuated,
so white and large-eyed, that in any other
presence he might have been deemed a dying man
himself. As he advances to the <i>ruelle</i> that encloses
the bed, he composes his thin lips and pinched face
into a decent expression of condolence. How can
he but <i>affect</i> to deplore the death of a minister whose
fierce passions overshadowed his whole life like a
moral upas-tree? Nevertheless the fitting phrases
are spoken, and he embraces the ghastly form
stretched out before him with a semblance of affection.
The expiring Cardinal presses the hand of his
master, and makes a sign that he would speak. Louis
bows down his head to catch the feeble voice, which
says—"Sire, I thank you for this honour; I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
spent my whole life in your service. I leave you
able ministers; trust them, Sire; but,"—and he
stops and struggles fearfully for breath,—"but, beware
of your Court. It is your <i>petit coucher</i> who
are dangerous. Your favourites have troubled me
more than all your enemies." Then the Cardinal
sinks back, fainting on his pillows.</p>

<p class="i1">Louis withdraws with affected concern; but, ere
he reaches the spacious anteroom, lined with the
Cardinal's retainers in magnificent liveries, he bursts
into an inhuman laugh—"There goes a great politician
to his death," he says to Chavigny, who is beside
him, and he points with his thumb towards the Cardinal's
chamber; "a wonderful genius. Now he is
gone I shall be free—I shall reign." He chuckles
with delight at the idea of being at last rid of the
Cardinal; and a grim smile spreads itself over his
ashen face.</p>

<p class="i1">It is a ghastly joke, as cruel as it is selfish. As if
Louis's life were bound up in the existence of his
great minister—he is himself a corpse within a year!</p>

after a long sojourn in Spain, England, and
Flanders,—for she loves travel and the adventures
of the road, either masked, or disguised as a page, a
priest, or a cavalier,—is reinstated in her Majesty's
favour. In Spain the Duchess's vanity was gratified
by enslaving a royal lover—the King of Spain,
brother of Anne of Austria; in England she diverted
herself with fomenting personal quarrels between
Charles I. and Henrietta Maria; in Flanders—a dull
country—she found little to amuse her.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle de Hautefort (soon to become Duchesse
and Maréchale de Schomberg) returns in obedience
to the Queen's command, who wrote to her even
when the King was alive, "Come, dearest friend, come
quickly. I am all impatience to embrace you!"</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Sennécy arrives from the provinces,
and the Chevalier de Jars from England.
The latter had been imprisoned in the Bastille, and
threatened with torture by Richelieu, to force him
to betray the Queen's correspondence with Spain at
the time of the Val de Grâce conspiracy. He had
been liberated, however, but while the Cardinal lived
had remained in England.</p>

<p class="i1">These, among many other faithful attendants, resume
their places at the <i>petit coucher</i>, in the <i>grand
cercle</i>, and at the morning <i>lever</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Then there are the princes and princesses of the
blood-royal:—Monsieur the Duc d'Orléans—no
longer breathing vows of love in the moonlight, but
a veteran intriguer—living on the road to Spain,
which always meant rebellion, together with his
daughter, <i>La Grande Mademoiselle</i>, a comely girl, the
greatest heiress in Europe; Cæsar, Duc de Vendôme,
son of Gabrielle and Henry IV., with his Duchess
and his sons, the Ducs de Mercœur and De Beaufort;
Condé, the uncrowned head of the great house
of Bourbon—more ill-favoured and avaricious than
ever—his jealous temper now excited against the
bastards of the house of Vendôme, with his wife,
Charlotte de Montmorenci, sobered down into a dignified
matron, devoted to her eldest son, the Duc
d'Enghien, and to her daughter, the Duchesse de
Longueville, the brightest ornament of the Court;
the Duc de Rochefoucauld and his son, the Prince
de Marsillac, the author of <i>Les Maximes</i>, to become
a shadow on the path of the last-named Duchess,
who is to die in a convent; the great House of La
Tour d'Auvergne, Viscomtes de Turenne and Ducs
de Bouillon, from which springs Henri de Turenne,
the rival of young Condé; Séguier, Duc de Villemer,
generously forgiven for the part he took against
the Queen as Chancellor, at the Val de Grâce; and,
last of all, Henry, Duc de Guise—by-and-by to
astonish all Europe by his daring escapade at Naples,
where, but for Masaniello, he might have been
crowned King, with the Queen's beautiful maid of
honour, Mademoiselle de Pons, at his side.</p>

<p class="i1">There is also about the Court a young man named
Giulio Mazarin, born in Rome of a Sicilian family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
late secretary to Cardinal Richelieu. He has passed
many years in Spain, and can converse fluently in
that language with her Majesty whenever she deigns
to address him. He has a pale, inexpressive face,
with large black eyes, <i>à fleur de tête</i>, generally bent
on the ground. His manners are modest, though
insinuating; his address is gentle, his voice musical.
Like all Italians, he is artistic; a <i>conoscente</i> in music,
a collector of pictures, china, and antiquities. So
unobtrusive and accomplished a gentleman cannot
fail to please, especially as he is only a deacon, and,
with a dispense, free to marry. The Queen, who
often converses with him in her native tongue, appreciates
his merits. Her minister, the Bishop of
Beauvais, leaves the Court. He finds that his presence
is useless, as the Queen acts entirely under the
advice of this young Italian, whom she also selects
as guardian to the young King, who, poor simple
boy, looks on Mazarin as a father.</p>

  <div class="caption">VICOMTE DE TURENNE.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">The Regency begins auspiciously. Fifteen days
after the death of Louis XIII. the decisive victory of
Rocroy was gained over the Spaniards by the Duc
d'Enghien, a youthful general of twenty-two. Paris
was exultant. The roads were strewed with wreaths
and flowers; tapestry and banners hung from every
window, fountains of choicest wines flowed at the
corners of the streets, and amid the booming of
cannon, the blare of trumpets, the crash of warlike
instruments, and the frantic shouts of an entire
population, the Queen, and her little four-year old
son, ride in a gold coach to hear a <i>Te Deum</i> at Notre-Dame.</p>

<p class="i1">Her Majesty's authority is much increased by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
victory. Mazarin, under favour of the Queen, gradually
acquires more and more power. He presides
at the council; he administers the finances—for which
he came to be called "<i>the plunderer</i>"; he tramples
on the parliament and bullies the young King. The
princes of the blood and all the young nobles are
excluded from offices of state or places in the household.
Every one begins to tremble before the once
modest young Italian, and to recall with dismay the
eighteen years of Richelieu's autocracy.</p>

<p class="i1">But Mazarin has a rival in Henri de Gondi, afterwards
Cardinal de Retz, now coadjutor to his uncle,
the Archbishop of Paris. No greater contrast can be
conceived than between the subtle, shuffling Italian,
patient as he is false, and Gondi, bold, liberal, independent,
generous even to his enemies, incapable of
envy or deceit, grasping each turn of fortune with
the ready adaptiveness of genius, and swaying the
passions of men by his fiery eloquence; a daring
statesmen, a resolute reformer, one of whom Cromwell
had said—"that he, De Retz, was the only man
in Europe who despised him."</p>

<p class="i1">Gondi considered himself sacrificed to the Church—for
which he had no vocation—and did his utmost,
by the libertinism of his early life, to render his ordination
impossible; but in vain. Although he had
abducted his own cousin, and been the hero of
numberless scandals, the Archbishopric of Paris was
considered a sinecure in the family of Gondi, and
Archbishop and Cardinal he must be in spite of his
inclination and of his excesses. In politics he was
a republican, formed on the pattern of Cato and of
Brutus, whose lives he had studied at the Sorbonne.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
He loved to be compared to Cicero and to Cataline,
and to believe himself called on to revolutionize
France after the fashion of a factious conspirator of
old Rome. He longed to be anything belligerent,
agitative—tribune, general, or demagogue. "Ancient
Rome," he said, "honoured crime, therefore crime
was to be honoured." "Rather let me be the leader
of a great party than an emperor!" exclaimed he,
in the climax of one of his thrilling perorations.
The mild precepts of the gospel were clearly little
to his taste. He had mistaken not only his vocation
but his century. He should have lived in the
Middle Ages; and as an ecclesiastical prince-militant
led armies into battle, conquered territories, and
made laws to subject peoples. Yet underlying the
wild enthusiasm of his language, and the reckless
energy of his actions, there was a kindly, almost
gentle temper that imparted to his character a certain
incompleteness which accounts for the falling
off of his later years. Grand, noble as was De Retz,
Mazarin ultimately beat him and remained master
of the situation.</p>

<p class="i1">Under the guidance of Gondi (De Retz) the parliament,
paralysed for a time, soon learns its power,
and gives unmistakable tokens of insubordination
by opposing every edict and tax proposed by the
Government. Some of the most fractious of "these
impertinent bourgeois," as Condé called them, were
arrested and exhibited in chains like captives in a
Roman triumph—at Notre-Dame on the occasion of
a second <i>Te Deum</i> sung for a second great victory
gained by young Condé. Mazarin, by this act, over-taxed
the endurance of the citizens. In one night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
two hundred barricades rise in the streets of Paris.
The Queen-Regent can see them from her windows.
This ebullition of popular fury appears to Gondi as
the realisation of his youthful dreams. The moment
has come to make him a tribune of the people. He
has loyally warned the Regent of the impending
peril. The Queen considered his words mere
bravado, and treated him personally with suspicion
and contempt. Gondi was warned that Mazarin
had decided on his exile. His generous nature was
outraged: "To-morrow," he said, "before noon, I
will be master of Paris." Noon did see him master
of Paris; but, loose as was his estimate of the sacredness
of his office, he was still Archbishop-Coadjutor;
he could not personally lead the rabble, or publicly
instigate the citizens to rebellion. A man of straw
must represent him, and do what he dared not—harangue
at the crosses and corners of the streets,
head the popular assemblies, and generally excite
the passions of the turbulent Parisians to fever heat.
This man of straw was found in the Duc de Beaufort,
grandson of Henri Quatre, through Gabrielle
d'Estrées,—a dandy, a swaggerer, but a warrior.</p>

<p class="i1">Now the Duc de Beaufort, hot-headed and giddy,
without either judgment or principles, cares little
for either Cardinal, Coadjutor, or Queen,—is utterly
indifferent as to who may rule or who may serve,
provided always his own claims, as prince of the
blood, to the most lucrative posts are admitted.
But he does care very much for an affront offered
to the Duchesse de Montbazon, of whom he is desperately
enamoured.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Montbazon, stepmother of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Duchesse de Chevreuse, and lady in waiting to the
Queen, finds late one evening, on returning to her
hotel, two love-letters dropped on the floor of her
private closet. One is from a gentleman, the other
is from a lady; both are unsigned. She of course
at once decides that the handwriting of the one is
that of the lady she most hates, that of the other,
the lover of that same lady, whom she hates even
more, if possible, than the lady herself. Now the
lady whom she hates most is the Duchesse de
Longueville, younger, more attractive, and more
powerful than herself. The gentleman she selects
is the Count de Coligni, who had deserted her for
the sake of the Duchess. The next morning, at the
Queen's lever, Madame de Montbazon shows these
two love-letters to every one, and being the mistress
of a caustic tongue, makes some diverting remarks
on their contents. Her words are repeated to the
Duchesse de Longueville; she denies the fact altogether.
Her mother, the Princesse de Condé, Charlotte
de Montmorenci, broadly hints to Anne of
Austria that the Prince de Condé, the greatest general
France had ever possessed since the days of the
Constable de Bourbon, will join the malcontent parliament,
nay, may even lead Spain into France, if
her Majesty does not instantly cause the Duchesse
de Montbazon to retract all she has said of his sister.
Such is patriotism under the Regency! The Queen,
overwhelmed by the clamour of the two duchesses, invokes
the help of Cardinal Mazarin. The Cardinal,
in his Italian-French, soothes and persuades both,
muttering many classic oaths of <i>Cospetto</i> and <i>Corpo di
Bacco</i> under his breath. He goes to and fro between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the ladies, flatters both, and proposes terms of apology.
Every suggestion is objected to; an hour is spent
over each word. Such a negotiation is far more
difficult than the government of France. All conclusion
seems impossible, the Queen at last speaks
with authority. She says that "if Madame de
Montbazon will not retract, she shall lose her place
at Court."</p>

<p class="i1">So Spain is not at this time to invade France
under the command of Condé, and the Duchesse de
Longueville is to receive an apology.</p>

<p class="i1">The apology is to be made at the Hôtel de Condé.
The Duchesse de Longueville—a superb blonde, with
melting blue eyes, golden-brown hair, transparent
complexion, and a dazzling neck and shoulders, a
coronet of orient pearls and a red feather on her
head, a chaplet of the same jewels clasping her
throat, wearing a robe of blue tissue, bordered and
worked with pearls—stands in the great saloon of
her father's ancestral palace. Her feet rest on a
dais of cloth of gold and silver; the dais is covered
by a canopy spangled with stars. The walls of the
saloon are covered with bright frescoes of birds,
fruit, and flowers, panelled into golden frames. Four
great chandeliers of crystal and silver are placed on
pedestals at each corner of the room, lighting up a
glittering crowd of princes and princesses of the
blood who stand beside the Duchess on the estrade.
The greatest nobles of France are present. The
doors are flung open, and the Duchesse de Montbazon,
a dainty brunette, brilliant, audacious, enticing,
who, although forty, is still in the zenith of her
charms, flashes into the room in full court costume,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
her sacque (or train) of amber satin brocaded with
gold reaching many yards behind her. The colour
on her cheeks is heightened either by rouge or passion;
her eyes glitter, and her whole bearing is of
one who would say, "I <i>must</i> do this, but I defy
you." She knows that all the gentlemen take part
with her, if the ladies side with her enemy. She
walks straight up to the dais on which the Duchesse
de Longueville, <i>née</i> Princesse de Condé, stands,
stops, looks her full in the face, then leisurely and
with the utmost unconcern casts her eyes round on
the company, smiles sweetly to the Duc de Beaufort,
and bows to those princes and nobles who are her
champions, particularly to the Ducs d'Orléans and
de Guise. Then she unfolds her painted fan, and
with insolent unconcern reads what follows from a
slip of pink paper attached to one of the jewelled
sticks:</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame, I come here to assure your highness
that I am quite innocent of any intention of injuring
you. Had it not been so I would humbly beg your
pardon, and willingly submit to any punishment her
Majesty might see fit to impose on me. I entreat
you, therefore, to believe that I have never failed in
the esteem which your virtues command, nor in the
respect due to your high rank."</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Longueville's soft blue eyes,
usually incapable of any other expression but tenderness
or supplication, look absolutely wicked, so
defiant is the bearing of Madame de Montbazon.
She advances to the edge of the estrade, draws herself
up with an imperious air, and casting a haughty
glance at her rival, who, crimson in the face, is fanning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
herself violently and ogling the Duc de Beaufort,
reading also from her fan, pronounces the
following words, dictated by Cardinal Mazarin:</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame, I am willing to believe that you took
no part in the calumny which has been circulated to
my prejudice. I make this acknowledgment in deference
to the commands of the Queen."</p>

<p class="i1">Thus ends the quarrel; but not the consequences.
The whole Court and city is in an uproar. The
citizens are deeply interested, and to a man take
part with the <i>chère amie</i> of Beaufort against the
Duchesse de Longueville, and against Condé and
Mazarin.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE GRAND CONDÉ.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Condé is not sure if he will not after all lead the
Spaniards against France. The Duchesse de Montbazon
feeds the flame for her private ends. She lays
all the blame of her humiliation on Cardinal Mazarin,
which exasperates Beaufort to madness. She incites
Henri, Duc de Guise, another of her adorers—the
wildest, bravest, and most dissolute of princes—to
challenge the Comte de Coligni, whom she had designated
as the writer of one of the love-letters. A
duel is fought in the Place Royale. The Duchesse
de Montbazon watches the while out of a window of
the palace of the Duc de Rohan, her cousin. Coligni
is killed. He falls, it is said, into the arms of the
Duchesse de Longueville, who is present on the
Place, disguised as a page.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duc de Beaufort, whose turbulent folly foreshadows
the <i>grand seigneur</i> of later reigns and almost
excuses the great Revolution, refuses to receive a
royal herald, sent to him by the Queen, turns his
back upon her Majesty at her lever, and threatens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the life of the Cardinal. The Duchesse de Montbazon
is banished.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Duc de Beaufort is summoned to a private
audience at the Louvre. On his way up the
grand staircase entering from the inner quadrangle
he meets his mother, the Duchesse de Vendôme, and
his sister, the Duchesse de Nemours, who, their attendance
on the Queen over, are descending.</p>

<p class="i1">"Good God! Francis," cries his mother, raising
her hands with a gesture of horror, "I thought you
were safe at Rambouillet. <i>You</i> within the Louvre
at this moment? You must be mad!" And she
throws herself upon him and tries to bar his further
passage.</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, my brother!" exclaims his sister Nemours,
in the same breath, throwing her arms around his
neck; "in the name of the Holy Virgin, do not tempt
your fate. Fly, dear Francis—fly, while you can—our
coach is waiting below—come with us instantly."
And Madame de Nemours takes him by the arm,
and tries to draw him downwards.</p>

<p class="i1">Beaufort plants himself firmly on the stair. His
first impulse is to push them both forcibly aside,
and to proceed; his next to curse their folly in
the spicy <i>argot</i> of the <i>halles</i>. He does neither; but
stands open-mouthed, his fierce eyes demanding an
explanation he does not condescend to ask. The
explanation is soon forthcoming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"My son," cries his mother, bursting into tears,
and seizing on his hand to detain him, as he makes
a motion as if to evade them, "listen to me, I implore
you. Your sister and I have been in waiting
on the Queen many hours to-day. She is terribly
incensed against you. People have been coming all
day with tales to her here, at the Louvre. Crowds
have filled her audience chamber."</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Mille Diables!</i> What do you mean, mother?"
bursts out Beaufort, shaking himself free from both
ladies. "You call me mad, if any one be mad it is
yourselves. I am here, summoned by the Queen
herself, to a private audience. <i>Ventre de ma vie!</i>"—Beaufort
much affects some of the favourite oaths
of his grandfather, Henri Quatre—"what are her
Majesty's humours to me?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Francis," sobs the Duchesse de Nemours,
"what have you done? You have threatened the
life of Cardinal Mazarin. The Queen knows it. She
has sent for you to secure your person. She can
have no other motive. Nothing can exceed her indignation.
She said, in my hearing, that you had
personally insulted her; that your party, the <i>Importants</i>,
were the curse of her reign; and that the
Duchesse de Montbazon corrupted the princes of
the blood by her intrigues. In the name of Heaven,
do not venture near her Majesty if you value your
liberty, or even your life!"</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Vendôme wrings her hands
while her daughter is speaking.</p>

<p class="i1">"For my sake, quit Paris, my dear son. If you
remain, not even Gondi can save you. Come with
us instantly, and cross the frontier while you can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Her words are broken; she trembles at her son's
manifest danger; Beaufort looks at her, shakes his
head, and bursts into a loud laugh.</p>

<p class="i1">"You are a couple of lunatics, both of you"—and
again he laughs—"I shall not leave Paris; I will not
even hide myself. Calm yourself, mother,"—and he
kisses her on the cheek—"her Majesty has summoned
me to a private audience. I shall obey her.
She is no traitress. I have been guilty of rudeness
towards her. I go to wipe out the remembrance of
it. I am rough, but not brutal, especially to the
Queen. Besides, <i>they dare not arrest me</i>."

These words, spoken by the Duc de Beaufort, are the same as
those of the Balafré, at Blois, before his assassination by Henry III.</p></div>

<p class="i1">Saying which, he pushes his mother and sister,
who still endeavour to stop him, on one side, and
bounds up the stairs.</p>

<p class="i1">It is evening. Anne of Austria is alone in a
spacious withdrawing-room, from which her private
writing-closet opens. Four lofty windows turn towards
the river—one is open. She sits beside it,
gazing at the dazzling tints of the summer sunset that
lace the western heavens with bars of fire. In front
rise the double towers of Notre-Dame. The fretted
spire of the Sainte-Chapelle glistens against a bank
of heavy clouds that are rapidly welling up from
the south. These clouds deepen with the twilight.
The lustre of a stormy sunset soon fades out.
The sun disappears, and darker and denser clouds
gather and thicken, and obscure the light. Low
thunder rumbles in the distance, and a few heavy
raindrops descend. Long shadows fall across the
floor, the corners of the room grow dark, and only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
a few bright gleams, lingering low on the horizon,
rest on the Queen's face and figure.</p>

<p class="i1">Anne of Austria has now passed into middle life;
her form is full, her movements heavy. The glorious
eyes are still lustrous, but no longer flash with the
fire of youth. Her hair, though still abundant, has
lost its glossy brightness. Her dress is rich, her
bearing cold and stately. She affects a distant, almost
a haughty manner, and is severe in exacting the
most rigid etiquette from all who approach her, save
alone the Cardinal. He comes and goes as he lists,
smiling and obsequious, but no longer humble or
subservient as of yore. Indeed, at times he treats
her Majesty with absolute familiarity, to the utter
dismay of the Duchesse de Chevreuse and Mademoiselle
de Hautefort. When not engaged with
Mazarin in state affairs, or in giving audiences, the
Queen passes her time in her oratory. Not only is
she devout herself, but exacts at all events the same
outward show of piety from her ladies.</p>

<p class="i1">Twilight has deepened into gloom, ere the Duc de
Beaufort enters. He stands in shadow, and as he
glances at the Queen, he inwardly apostrophises his
mother and sister as a couple of fools and gossips,
for imagining him to be in any danger of her displeasure.
His boisterous bearing—for he affects the
manners of the lowest of the populace, the better to
sway them, and by so doing to embarrass the minister—is
visibly softened. He remembers with pain
the insults of which he has been guilty in turning his
back on the Queen, when they last met, and in refusing
to receive her herald. He is both repentant and
flattered at her summons. His obeisance to her is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
unusually low, and some tokens of emotion betray
themselves on his dissipated, though handsome countenance.</p>

<p class="i1">"Good evening, cousin," says Anne of Austria, as
he enters, a gracious smile upon her face, and with
that queenly grace natural to her, she presents her
still beautiful hand to him, which he kisses kneeling.
"Where have you been these four days past? You
are a stranger at the Louvre."</p>

<p class="i1">Her voice is sweet, her look is gentle. It is
impossible that what Beaufort has heard can be
true.</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame," he answers, bowing, "had I not been
absent from Paris, I should not have failed to present
my duty to your Majesty. But I am only just returned
from a hunting-party at Rambouillet, whither I went
with my brother-in-law, Nemours. Until I came back
I did not know that you had asked for me. What can
I do for your Majesty's service? I am always at your
command."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, cousin, you are always at my command, I
know," answers the Queen, repeating his words, and
she gives a little laugh. Beaufort winces at the covert
rebuke. He feels that her meaning must be ironical,
yet she speaks caressingly, and the same gracious
smile still plays about her mouth.</p>

<p class="i1">"You once called me the most honourable man in
France, Madame; I am proud to remember it."
Beaufort speaks roughly, and in a loud voice; the
momentary polish is passing away with the momentary
emotion. "I am what I ever was. I do not
change. I wish I could say the same of your Majesty.
Madame, you have greatly altered," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
he looks at her straight in the face. Anne of Austria
shifts her position, so as to sit in shadow, then she
replies:—</p>

<p class="i1">"I have no <i>special</i> purpose in summoning you,
cousin, save for the satisfaction your presence here
gives me." Again Beaufort feels the covert stab, and
observes that she studiously avoids noticing his remarks
on her altered conduct towards him.</p>

<p class="i1">"You and I," adds the Queen, in a voice strangely
monotonous, "are indeed old friends and comrades
as well as cousins."</p>

<p class="i1">"You have not a truer friend in whole France than
I am," answers the Duke vehemently, and he advances
a step or two towards the window, near which the
Queen sits, raises his hand to emphasise his words,
and lets it fall so heavily on a table near as to make
the whole room echo. The Queen still smiles graciously.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, Madame, I am no courtier; I hate courts;
but before you made that Italian <i>facchino</i> your
favourite you relied on Beaufort." As he pronounced
the Cardinal's name his face hardens and his hands
clench themselves; an almost imperceptible shudder
passes over the Queen. Then he continues:—</p>

<p class="i1">"Was it not to Beaufort that you entrusted the
sacred person of his Majesty and your own safety
after the death of your husband, before the Regency
was settled?"</p>

<p class="i1">Anne of Austria bows her head in silence. She is
evidently determined not to take offence. If any one
else had dared to mention the Cardinal to her in
such language she would have ordered him to the
Bastille.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Had the Duke been less giddy this knowledge
ought to have curbed him, especially after the warning
he had received; but his thoughts are now
passing into a different channel, and he heeds it not.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, cousin, I have known you long, and closely,"
is the Queen's cautious rejoinder. "You have been
at Rambouillet, Prince," she continues; "have you
had good sport? The canals there are, I am told,
full of fat carp. Do you love fishing?"</p>

<p class="i1">The Duke stares at her without replying. The
Queen, who appears to desire to continue the conversation,
yet to avoid all discussion, still speaks—</p>

<p class="i1">"My son will grow up to be a keen sportsman, I
hope. The royal forests must be better guarded.
Did you and the Duc de Nemours find any deer at
Rambouillet?"</p>

<p class="i1">Spite of the Queen's unusual loquacity, there is
something in her manner which irritates the excitable
Duke. He cannot altogether convince himself that
she is not mocking him. He had come certainly repentant,
but his fiery temper now overmasters him
at the bare suspicion.</p>

<p class="i1">"Did your Majesty send for me to put such questions
as these?" cries he roughly. "If so, I would
rather have stayed at Rambouillet."</p>

<p class="i1">"Truly, Duke," replies the Queen evasively, colouring
at his bluntness, "it is difficult to content you.
I have already said that I summoned you for no
special purpose, save that we might converse together"—and
she stops suddenly, and hesitates—"as
cousins, and <i>as friends</i>."</p>

<p class="i1">This last word is spoken slowly and with manifest
effort. Her voice, which has a strange ring in it, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
drowned by a clap of thunder, still distant, and a
flash of lightning illuminates the room for an instant,
and rests upon the long, fair hair and frowning countenance
of Beaufort. Her words are bland, but her
bearing is distant and constrained. Even the unobservant
Beaufort is struck by this anomaly; but he
attributes it to some vestige of displeasure at his
late conduct.</p>

<p class="i1">"I trust, Madame, you will always treat me with
the confidence proper to both these titles," he replies
stiffly.</p>

<p class="i1">Her words appease, but do not satisfy him. Even
while speaking, the Queen has turned her head towards
the door of her writing closet, and listens.
The wind roars without, and the waters of the Seine
dash themselves against the low walls that border
the Quay, but no sound within is audible. Anne of
Austria resumes the conversation as though talking
against time. But Beaufort, naturally unobservant,
is now too much excited to notice this. He has
forgotten all that his mother and sister had said.
Not the slightest suspicion crosses his mind.</p>

<p class="i1">"It is a boisterous evening," continues the Queen,
looking out of the window—a faint flash of lightning
plays round her darkly robed figure—"but the storm
is still distant. By-the-bye, my cousin, am I to
congratulate you on being appointed beadle of
Saint-Nicholas des Champs?" asks the Queen, still
smiling. "The bourgeoisie must be greatly flattered
by your condescension."</p>

<p class="i1">"That is a matter of opinion," answers Beaufort.
"I glory in belonging to the people. I would rather
be called <i>Roi des Halles</i> than King of France."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The Queen says no more, again she listens. She
seems more and more embarrassed, and the conversation
languishes. The Duke begins to be conscious
that something is amiss. He even goes the length
of secretly wishing that the interview were over. A
heaviness oppresses him; it is stiflingly hot, and the
thunder sounds nearer. The image of his mother
weeping bitterly rises up, unbidden, before him.
Can there be any truth in her warning?</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes," continues Beaufort, after an awkward pause,
"yes, I may be too much of a <i>Frondeur</i> to please
you, Madame, and for my own safety also." Again
the Queen turns her head, and listens anxiously.
"A <i>Frondeur</i> against a government headed by an
alien—not a <i>Frondeur</i> against you, my cousin—never
against <i>you</i>. To <i>you</i> I am ever loyal. You
know this." His voice grew thick. He is much
moved. "You, my cousin, can never forget my long
exile, after the death of Cinq-Mars at Lyons, for your
sake. Surely you cannot forget?"</p>

<p class="i1">Anne moves uneasily; she taps her small foot on
the floor impatiently. Her eyes are bent outwards
upon the approaching storm, which draws each instant
nearer. The heavens are now like a wall of
blackness, save where the lightning glitters for a
moment. Yet she neither calls for lights, nor closes
the window.</p>

<p class="i1">"Next to the Duchesse de Chevreuse," Beaufort
continues, "Richelieu hated me, because I was devoted
soul and body to you, and he knew it. Ah,
my cousin, had the Duchess and I, your two friends,
spoken, where would you have been now? Not on
the throne, certainly. I carried your secret safely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
into England with me—I would have carried it to
the grave—and you are Regent of France."</p>

<p class="i1">Whatever the Queen may feel, she carefully conceals
it. A stony expression spreads itself over her
face, and the smile on her lip becomes almost a
grimace, her mouth is so tightly set.</p>

<p class="i1">"If I am grown rough and coarse," he continues,
"like the rabble among whom I live—if I offend you
by my frankness, remember Beaufort was faithful to
you in adversity—most true and faithful."</p>

<p class="i1">The tears come into his eyes as he speaks; he
brushes them off with his sleeve. The Queen is not
at all moved by this appeal. A third time she turns
her head as if listening for some expected sound—then,
hearing nothing, her eyelids drop, and she plays
with her fan.</p>

<p class="i1">"These are difficult times, my cousin," she says
at last, speaking slowly. "Much depends on the
princes of the blood. I reckon on you, Duke, as a
firm pillar of the State," and she touches him with
her fan.</p>

<p class="i1">Beaufort starts. "Would I were such a pillar!"
he exclaims with warmth. "Take Gondi as your
minister, my cousin. Send Mazarin back to the
Roman gutter from whence he sprung. You would
have no more trouble with the parliament. I warrant
you they would obey you like lambs, my cousin.
Banish Mazarin, and I will lead you and the young
King in triumph throughout France. Not a <i>Frondeur</i>
would be left in the land. If there were, I would
shoot him with my own hand. Answer me, Madame;
will you try?"</p>

<p class="i1">Beaufort stretches out his hand as he speaks, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
clasp that of the Queen. Anne neither stirs, neither
looks up, nor touches his hand. To speak is evidently
difficult to her. Surely she must be expecting some
one, for she again turns her head towards the writing-closet
and listens. A sharp clap of thunder rattles
through the room; when it is past her eyes rest
upon the Duke, who is eagerly awaiting her reply.
The set smile is still on her lips; she is about to
answer him, when a distinct sound of footsteps is
heard within in her writing-closet. A page enters, and
announces Cardinal Mazarin's arrival to consult her
Majesty on urgent state business. Beaufort's face
darkens. Ere the page has ceased speaking, the
long-gathering storm bursts forth with fury. A tremendous
peal of thunder shakes the palace, and big
drops of rain are driven through the window. The
Queen rises hastily and signs to the page to close
the sash. She is evidently greatly relieved. "I regret
this interruption, Prince," she says, speaking
rapidly, "but it is unavoidable. I must not keep
the Cardinal waiting. I cannot, however, consider
your audience as over. Will your highness favour
me by remaining in the apartments of the ladies of
honour until I am free?" and, not waiting for his
reply, she hastily passes into her closet. Deluges of
rain fall, flash after flash lights up the heavens, and
peals of thunder rapidly succeed each other.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duc de Beaufort finds the Duchesse de
Chevreuse and Mademoiselle de Hautefort sitting
together in one of the apartments of the suite allotted
to the ladies in waiting. As he enters they
both rise hurriedly, and contemplate him in mute
astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Why, Duke," cries the Duchess, "is it possible?
You here? You in the Louvre?"</p>

<p class="i1">"And why not, madame? What do these chattering
women mean?" he mutters to himself. "One
would think I were a monster."</p>

<p class="i1">"What! have you not heard, that you are accused
of a plot to assassinate the Cardinal?"</p>

<p class="i1">"The Queen knows the particulars," broke in
Mademoiselle de Hautefort. "She told me so at
her lever this morning."</p>

<p class="i1">"Perhaps you will kindly inform me what these
particulars are, madame?" replies Beaufort savagely.</p>

<p class="i1">"Why, Duke, you must be out of your senses!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Not that I know of, madame; pray let me hear
of what I am accused."</p>

<p class="i1">"Why, that in order to take the Cardinal's life
you had stationed soldiers in ambush along the road
to Longchamps, to fire on him, as he passed in his
coach on his way to dine with the President Maison."</p>

<p class="i1">"The simple-hearted Cardinal! Imagine, your
highness," cries the Duchess, "Signor Giulio, after
having said his prayers, trotting along demurely in
his red coach, a perfect angel—wanting only wings
to fly away from a wicked world, innocent of so much
as an evil thought! We know you are a <i>Frondeur</i>,
Duke, but you are also a barbarian to desire the life
of such a saint," and the Duchess laughs her merry
laugh.</p>

<p class="i1">"Perhaps, madame," says Beaufort, turning towards
Mademoiselle de Hautefort, "you will have
the goodness to proceed in the relation of my supposed
crime?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"I have neither the wit nor the high spirits of her
Grace of Lorraine," replies she, "to jest. I assure
you, Duke, it is a very grave matter. You are in the
utmost danger. The Cardinal has made her Majesty
believe that his life was only saved by the accidental
arrival of the Duc d'Orléans—who was going to dine
at the same party—on horseback, and who, as a violent
shower of rain came on, dismounted and got
into the Cardinal's coach. His presence saved the
Cardinal, the guard could not fire upon his Royal
Highness. You may imagine the agitation of her
Majesty."</p>

<p class="i1">"Capital, capital!" exclaims the Duchess, clapping
her hands, and still laughing; "admirably done.
I never gave your highness credit for so much invention.
What a pity the Duc d'Orléans did not start
a little sooner," adds she, in a lower voice, "or that
it rained! Signor Giulio would have been in heaven
by this time."</p>

<p class="i1">The Duc de Beaufort sees that Mademoiselle de
Hautefort looks both concerned and vexed at this
levity. He had left his mother and sister as he
entered, in tears. Was it possible all this might be
true?</p>

<p class="i1">"I beseech you, Duke, to leave the Louvre while
you can," says Mademoiselle de Hautefort, very
earnestly.</p>

<p class="i1">"But I am waiting here, madame, at the express
command of her Majesty, until Mazarin, with whom
she is now engaged in the council-chamber,
retires."</p>

<p class="i1">"Are they alone?" asks the Duchess.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, madame."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Then, Duke, I do advise you at once to escape
while you can. If her Majesty told you to remain,
and she is now closeted with Mazarin, the sooner
you pass the gates of Paris the better; unless your
highness particularly desire to air the best set of
rooms in the Bastille; and even they are dull," she
adds, with that invincible desire to laugh and make
others laugh, at once her charm and her defect.</p>

<p class="i1">Careless as is the Duc de Beaufort, his confidence
is shaken. He had taken up his velvet cap to depart,
when a knock is heard at the door.</p>

<p class="i1">"Come in," cries the Duchess.</p>

<p class="i1">It was Guitaut, Captain of the Queen's Guards.
He walks up to the Duke, and lays his hand on his
shoulder: "I command your highness to follow me,
in the name of the King and of the Queen-Regent."</p>

<p class="i1">Even the Duchess becomes serious.</p>

<p class="i1">Beaufort eyes Guitaut for some time in silence.
"This is very strange, Guitaut. There must be
some mistake. I am here by her Majesty's commands,
awaiting a further audience."</p>

<p class="i1">"I know nothing of that, your highness. My instructions
are precise. You are under arrest."</p>

<p class="i1">Beaufort unbuckles his sword. He presents it to
Guitaut. Then he turns to the Duchess and Mademoiselle
de Hautefort, whose countenances express
the concern they both feel. "You are witness,
ladies, that I, a prince of the blood, am arrested
when, in obedience to her Majesty's commands, I
am awaiting the honour of a further audience.
<i>Pardieu</i>, that sneaking varlet, Mazarin, shall pay for
this. The Coadjutor will revenge me. Lead on,
Guitaut. Where is it to be? The Bastille?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"I have orders to conduct your highness to the
Castle of Vincennes," replies Guitaut, bowing.</p>

<p class="i1">"To Vincennes! And by the Queen's order!
<i>Ventre de ma vie!</i> she is a traitress after all!"</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Queen could no longer appear in the streets
without insult. The mob laughed in her face,
and called her <i>Madame Anne</i>. They saluted Mazarin
with howls, as her <i>bon ami</i>; some said <i>amant</i>. The
words sound much alike when shouted by a mob,
and are not indeed always different in point of fact.
Gondi, in the parliament, uttered thrilling words
about <i>la belle France</i> going to perdition between a
Spanish regent and an Italian minister. No president
was found to rebuke him. Indeed when he
demanded that the law respecting aliens holding
office of state, passed against Concini (Maréchal
d'Ancre) in the regency of Marie de' Medici, should
be amended to suit the present crisis, his words were
received with such a fury of applause that the roof
was very nearly brought down about his head. Yet
if any single member of that noisy parliament had
been asked what national misfortune he dreaded,
what unpunished crime, what neglect, or what
personal hardship he desired to redress, he would
have found it difficult to answer. It was the fashion
for every one to be discontented and to rebel. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
citizens, to call themselves <i>Frondeurs</i>; if nobles, <i>Importants</i>.
To object to everything; to harass the
Government, refuse to pay taxes and subsidies; and
to threaten to call in Spain on the most trivial pretences.
And this because two duchesses had
quarrelled, and certain hungry princes had lost the
sinecures they craved for. Thus began the civil war
of the Fronde, which lasted during the whole of the
minority of Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="i1">Mazarin, when he heard that the parliament,
lashed on by Gondi, the Coadjutor, seriously proposed
to revive an obsolete law, which would connect
his name with that of Concini, who had been
shot down like a dog within the precincts of the
Louvre, was alarmed. Not being a soldier like
Richelieu, nor a patriot like De Retz, but only a
soft-spoken Italian, with a slight frame,—no unnecessary
bones or muscles,—long thin hands, and a
sallow, womanish face, he applied to the all-powerful
Condé for help. Condé effected a compromise with
Gondi. So no more was heard of the obnoxious
law at that particular time. But the parliament had,
like a young lion, tasted blood in the way of power,
liked it, and was not to be appeased. Spite of
Condé, seditious edicts and offensive measures, all
suggested by the Coadjutor, continued to be passed;
and Mazarin shut himself up within four walls, fearing
for his very life.</p>

<p class="i1">It is night and very dark; only a few ill-trimmed
lamps placed on pulleys across the street, and under
the signs of the various shops, at long distances from
each other, cast a dim and flickering light. The unpaved
streets are muddy and full of holes; a mob is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
collecting in the darkness between the Louvre, the
Church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, and the garden
of the Palais Royal. It thickens every moment;
group after group of men and some women emerge
from the gloom. They pour down from Saint-Jacques
and from Saint-Antoine, from the quays and
the heart of the old Roman city about Notre-Dame
and the Hôtel Dieu. They gather from all quarters.
Before an hour has passed, a dense multitude, many
thousands in number, are packed together. Those
who stand under the dim lamps have a dogged,
resolute look. All eyes are directed towards the
Palais Royal, separated by a high wall from the
street. The huge building rises up a gaunt mass
before them. Not a light is to be seen at any of
the windows; not a sentinel is visible, they are withdrawn
within the postern. Threats and oaths and
ribald jests pass from mouth to mouth loudly and
without fear; savage cries and shouts of laughter
ring along the silent streets. Anne of Austria, with
her two sons, is within the palace. She is quite
aware what is passing without. From an upper
window, in a darkened room, she watches the citizens
pressing closer and closer to the gates. From
amid the tumult, groans and imprecations are now
audible; the words reach her ears. "Where is the
little King?" cries one. "We will see him!" shrieks
another. "You fool! he is not here," answers a
third, a smith, as black as his forge, from the slums
of Saint-Antoine. "Why not? where should he be
but at home?" another voice asks. "We will force
the gates, and find him!" roars a stumpy man, with
stentorian voice, shaking his fist, and struggling to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the front. "Find him! where will you find him?
he is in Spain," shouts one at his elbow. "Curses
on the Italian priest!" howl many voices in horrible
chorus. This cry excites the entire multitude to
frenzy; it is taken up from all parts, and a volley of
groans and curses for a time drowns all else. The
crowd surges to and fro, like breakers on a rocky
shore. Each moment it approaches nearer the
palace. A tall spare man, an emissary of De Retz,
who all along has taken an active part in inciting
the people, seizes on the moment as propitious, and
calls out in a loud voice, "Death to Mazarin!"
Thousands re-echo, "Death to Mazarin!" With
hideous gesticulations they throw their arms aloft;
caps fly into the air; innumerable hands are clapped
in savage applause. "Death to Mazarin!" passes
down the lines of the long streets. It is heard at
the crossways, and at every side alley and opening,
dying away in the far distance into indistinct
murmurs.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i-086.jpg" id="i-086.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i-086.jpg"
        alt="" />
  <div class="caption">CARDINAL DE RETZ.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">The Queen hears this death-cry standing at the
darkened window, and trembles. Again the maddened
people shout, "Death to Mazarin!" and
again, "Death!" is echoed from afar. "He has
spirited away our little Louis into Spain to kill him!"
"He has murdered the Regent!" yells out the tall,
spare man, forcing his way hither and thither.
"Death to the traitor!" "To the gallows with all
foreigners!" is the murderous response of the mob.</p>

<p class="i1">Fresh cries now arise, led by the tall, spare man
with the powerful voice. "<i>Vive</i> Gondi, our noble
bishop! We will have Gondi! the Queen shall
choose Gondi, our Coadjutor!" "Come forth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
answer to us, Dame Anne!" shrieks a woman's shrill
voice, very near the palace, during a momentary lull.
"Come forth, or we will break in and shoot you!
Where is our <i>Roi des Halles</i>? Where is Beaufort?
Come out to us, and speak like an honest woman!
Let Beaufort free!—Give up your lover, Mazarin!"
bellows a fat beldame from the Halles. "Give up
the <i>bon ami</i>, and we will roast him at the Grève, and
dance round the bonfire!" and hideous peals of
laughter, yells, hisses, and imprecations rise out of
the night. Then, growing impatient, the whole
mass, with one accord, vociferate, "We will see the
King! where is the King? Show us the little King,
or we will set fire to the palace. The King! the
King!"</p>

<p class="i1">A tremendous rush is made from behind; those
in front fall down, screaming that they are killed;
others trample upon their bodies. The gates are
forced; the foremost find themselves within the
court. Pushed on by the press from behind, they
now stand under the colonnade, then beneath the
portico, on past the Queen's Guards, who, commanded
only to defend, not to attack, stand back,
drawn swords in their hands, darkly eying the rioters.
The lofty portals of the Palais Royal are wide
open; there are lights within the ample hall. Beyond
is the grand staircase, with gilded banisters.
Finding no obstacle, the rioters mount the stairs.
On the first landing a woman stands, immovable.
It is the Queen. She is alone. She is pale, but betrays
no fear. The rude intruders draw back,
amazed at the vision of majesty and loveliness before
them. Anne of Austria beckons to them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
advance. She places her finger on her lip, commanding
silence. The rabble, before so noisy, are
instantly hushed as by a charm. Signing to the
foremost to follow her, she leads the way, through
sumptuous chambers and vaulted galleries, to the
King's sleeping-room. She approaches his little bed
of gilt lattice-work, and gently drawing aside the
lace curtains, displays Louis XIV. in the sound and
tranquil sleep of childhood. The citizen <i>Frondeurs</i>
are satisfied. The mothers bless his baby face and
rich auburn curls. The men contemplate the Queen
with awe. She stands beside the bed, surveying
them with royal unconcern. When they have stared
their full at the little King and at her, those who
have already entered turn back. No others dare
approach. Ashamed and silent, they retreat across
the halls and through sculptured galleries in a very
different spirit to that in which they came.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">Anne of Austria grows more and more devout.
She spends long hours in her oratory, prostrate before
an image of the Magdalene. She often retires
to the Val de Grâce, where she has built a splendid
church, as a thank-offering for the birth of her sons.
For days together she wears closely fitting serge
dresses, buttoned up to the throat, like a lay nun.
She fasts, and chastises herself with a severity proper
alike to a sinner or a saint.</p>

<p class="i1">Yet there are whispers, and confidences, and anecdotes
touching her intimacy with Cardinal Mazarin,
not quite in accordance with such excessive austerity.</p>

<p class="i1">It is a <i>liaison</i> too public for intrigue, uneasy
enough for marriage!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The constant reproaches she addresses to her
ladies in waiting for their lack of devotion, tends
rather to enrage than to edify these pretty sinners.
Mademoiselle de Pons, with a smile and a toss of
the head, draws Mademoiselle de la Mothe into a
corner, and repeats some hard words the Queen has
spoken to her. Mademoiselle de Hautefort, of a
quick, impulsive temperament, is continually either
in a passion or in tears. The Duchesse de Chevreuse
is usually grave, and more silent than she ever was
before. The Duchesse de Noailles, lady of the bedchamber,
her attendance at the Palais Royal over,
orders her coach, and, in company with the Duchesse
de Sennécy, returns home to her <i>hôtel</i> in the Place
Royale, in a very bad humour. Here a party of
ladies, "her nineteen bosom friends," are awaiting
her arrival. They are all eager for gossip, and all
pledged to a vow of eternal secrecy, a promise they
will keep as long as the retailer of the scandal is
speaking. Coffee has been handed round in delicate
cups of Oriental porcelain. Bonbons and cakes,
served on trays of gold <i>repoussé</i>, have been discussed;
the ladies lean back in their chairs, to listen with
greater ease. Then the Duchesse de Noailles, addressing
herself particularly to Madame de Sennécy
and a certain Comtesse de Lude, remarkable for a
thin pinched face and a very red nose, begins.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"MESDAMES, you have asked me to give you
some details of what is passing in the palace.
I will do so; but do not imagine, for Heaven's
sake, that I wish to spread evil reports or to act
<i>la scandaleuse</i>. Far from it; as long as I remain in
the Queen's service, whatever her conduct may be
towards me, I shall bear it. I shall not dream of
revenge."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, dear, no, not in the least," the ladies murmur;
"nothing can be more proper."</p>

<p class="i1">"But, really, when I see such an affectation of devotion,
that serge gown, and no ornaments except
on state receptions; such severity, too, towards
every one who dresses like the rest of the world—she
told me the other day my dress was too <i>décolleté</i>—can
you conceive?—it is more than human nature
can bear. It sets me remembering certain stories
well known to everybody within the palace, when
her Majesty wore low dresses too, and was not <i>quite</i>
such a <i>dévote</i> as she pretends to be now."</p>

<p class="i1">The assembled ladies assent silently. The Duchesse
de Noailles, who is excited and has spoken
quickly, having stopped to take breath, the Duchesse
de Sennécy seizes the moment to break in—</p>

<p class="i1">"You may do as you please, dear Duchess, but for
my part I am indignant with her Majesty. She has
no gratitude. I might have ruined her years ago,
when my cousin, Louise de Lafayette, could turn the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
late King Louis XIII. round her finger; one word
from her, and the Queen would have been exiled!
I am indignant, I repeat—I am actually not allowed
to choose my own confessor! Her Majesty insists
that I should select a Jesuit—a <i>protégé</i> of Mazarin—a
man, as I believe, not to be trusted. And the
reason she gives is, 'that it is for the good of my
soul!' I can take care of my own soul, I suppose.
I always confess twice a year. What is it to her
Majesty if I do not confess at all!"</p>

<p class="i1">All the ladies murmur acquiescence, and the red-nosed
Countess, Madame de Lude, says, "It is an
impertinence."</p>

<p class="i1">"Every one must see," continues Madame de Sennécy,
speaking rapidly, for she observes that Madame
de Noailles is eager to proceed, "the power Mazarin
exercises over her. In her youth Richelieu loved
her: now it is Mazarin. She is born to ensnare the
Sacred College—perhaps his Holiness himself, if he
crossed the Apennines——"</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Duchess," exclaim several voices, "how
shocking!" and some ladies hold up their fans before
their faces.</p>

<p class="i1">"Gently, madame," says Madame de Noailles, interrupting;
"I detest calumny. I only speak of the
past—that cannot hurt her Majesty."</p>

<p class="i1">"I speak of the present," cries Madame de Sennécy
with irritation. "There is quite enough to
talk about in the present, without recalling the past.
The partiality of the Queen positively injures Mazarin.
I believe that this is the principal reason of the
great animosity against him among the citizens of
Paris, who call themselves <i>Frondeurs</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"But, my <i>très chère</i>," answers Madame de Noailles,—the
Mrs. Candour of that day, who, although quite
as spiteful as her friend, had more discretion, and
dreaded the mischief that might arise by-and-by if the
tongues of all the assembled ladies were let loose,—"but,
my <i>très chère</i>, it is believed that her Majesty
is privately married to Mazarin; the Cardinal has
never taken priest's orders; the Queen is a widow.
Madame de Motteville is of this opinion; <i>enfin</i>,
I believe it myself: else that sneaking, honey-mouthed
Italian, whom we all knew as 'Signor
Giulio,' secretary to the great Richelieu, would never
dare to be so unkind to the King and the little Duke,
or so arrogant to her Majesty."</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Ciel!</i> how contemptuously Mazarin answers the
Queen sometimes—how meekly she bears it!" exclaims
Madame de Sennécy. "Beringhen tells me
that he will not allow the King and his brother
proper body-linen, and that the sheets of their beds
are in holes."</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Ah, Dieu!</i> what a shame," cry the ladies—"the
King of France!"—and the red-nosed Countess declares,
"That the parliament ought to know it."</p>

<p class="i1">This idea alarms Madame de Noailles extremely.
She does not want to lose her place at Court, yet it
is sweet to her to hear the Queen abused, who had
so sternly forbade her to appear again before her in
such low dresses.</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, Mazarin is bad enough, mesdames," cries
Madame de Sennécy (not to be quelled by the
frowns and signs of her senior); "he is bad enough—the
blood-sucker—as that dear handsome Duc de
Beaufort calls him; but, for my part, I can tolerate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
him much better than those nieces of his, who come
up one by one from Rome—Mancini and Martinozzi,
or whatever he calls them—with their bold Italian
looks and big eyes, devouring every man they see.
How intolerable they are!"</p>

<p class="i1">"They are quite improper," puts in the red-nosed
Countess, "and very ugly."</p>

<p class="i1">Some of the ladies say they do not think so.
Others declare that they are sallow, bony, and ill
shaped. Madame de Sennécy ends the discussion
by declaring that one is deformed, and that the
other limps; a statement utterly untrue, but which
is received as gospel. Madame de Noailles declares
that she is sure the Queen would never allow such
creatures to be about the Court if she could help it.
It is most dangerous for his Sacred Majesty to be
educated with them. He might become attached to
Olympia, for instance, the eldest unmarried one.</p>

<p class="i1">A shudder passes through the assembled ladies
at such a monstrous supposition. The red-nosed
Countess opines that the princes of the blood should
have such hussies imprisoned in the Bastille, and fed
on bread and water.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, ladies," cries Madame de Noailles, in her
shrill voice, "how little you know of the intrigues of
a Court! Mazarin fully intends to marry his saucy
niece, Olympia, to the King. The Queen cannot help
it; she is in his power; she is his wife."</p>

<p class="i1">"It is to be hoped so," mutters Madame de Sennécy;
and the red-nosed Countess shakes her head,
and by this significant gesture endorses her doubt of
the fact.</p>

<p class="i1">"I wish you would listen to me," says the Duchesse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
de Noailles peevishly. "I was alluding to some curious
old stories connected with the Queen; but perhaps,
ladies, you know them already," and she looks inquiringly
around.</p>

<p class="i1">"Very imperfectly," lisps a thin demoiselle of uncertain
age, who had been disappointed of the situation
of maid of honour. And the red-nosed Countess
settles herself in her chair, drinks another cup of
coffee, and begs Madame de Noailles to proceed.
Madame de Sennécy also joins in the same request.
Another lady, a hanger-on of the Duchesse de Noailles,
who had not yet spoken, says, "It is well known that
Madame la Duchesse relates everything in such a
<i>piquante</i> manner." Thus encouraged, the Duchess
begins:—</p>

<p class="i1">"I desire to speak of the past. The past cannot
injure her Majesty. I am without prejudice, and incapable
of malice." The Duchesse de Sennécy laughs
behind her fan. "I have listened to all Madame de
Sennécy has said with deep concern;" and she crosses
her hands, and looks up at the ceiling with mock
solemnity. "I am lady of the bedchamber to the
Queen—a position involving certain duties, certain
reserves. God forbid I should forget them!" Madame
de Sennécy stares at her with amazement, wondering
what is coming next. "Her Majesty was so cautious
formerly—so cautious, I say—nothing more—it is not
likely she would commit herself now. I do not therefore
agree with Madame de Sennécy in her opinion
that she is privately married to Mazarin."</p>

<p class="i1">"Then she ought to be," the red-nosed Countess
says sententiously.</p>

<p class="i1">"Remember she had Madame de Chevreuse to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
help her formerly," thrusts in Madame de Sennécy
sharply.</p>

<p class="i1">"With your permission, ladies, I will begin my
narrative. But if you interrupt me, I cannot do so."
and Madame de Noailles draws herself up with an
offended air. "A thousand pardons!" every one exclaims.
Not a sound is heard. The Duchess, somewhat
pacified, surveys her audience. "I presume,
ladies, we all adore the miracle wrought in the person
of his present Majesty for the continuance of the
royal line; I say, in the person of our present Majesty,
Louis XIV., a miracle which was brought about
by the intercession of that saint, your cousin, Mademoiselle
Louise de Lafayette;" she turns towards Madame
de Sennécy, who bows. "It was Mademoiselle
de Lafayette who persuaded the King to visit the
Queen at the Louvre. A miracle—eh, my dear
friends?" and a malicious smile plays about her
mouth, and she casts up her eyes and pauses; "a
wonderful miracle after twenty-two years of sterility,
and the King, too, almost in his grave!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Quite so," replies the Duchesse de Sennécy; "incredible!"
All the ladies laugh. The red-nosed
Countess declares she never had believed it; which
was exactly what Madame de Noailles intended,
though she would not have said so for the world!</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, after this truly miraculous event, and when
their Majesties were as much alienated as ever—for
the Queen never forgave the insult the King put upon
her at the Val de Grâce, in summoning her before
the council, and making the Chancellor search her
papers—their Majesties being, I repeat, as much
alienated as ever, the Beau Buckingham came to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Court.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
But, mesdames, this is a long story; you will
be fatigued."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="i1"><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, favourite of James I., and
of his son, Charles I., assassinated by Felton, 1628.</p></div>

<p class="i1">"No, no—not in the least," answer all the ladies,
speaking at once. "Go on, Duchess, pray go on; tell
us about the Beau Buckingham. Did he not let
pearls fall from his dress, and when they were picked
up refuse to take them back?" asks the Duchesse de
Sennécy.</p>

<p class="i1">"Exactly," replies Madame de Noailles. "Buckingham
was a grand seigneur."</p>

<p class="i1">"Pray go on, madame."</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, mesdames, an embassy came from Charles I.
of England—poor man, he had his head cut off afterward—how
perfidious those English are!—to ask the
hand of our Princess Henrietta Maria—daughter of
Marie de' Medici and Henry IV.—in marriage. The
Beau Buckingham was the ambassador chosen, and
such a one was never seen before; so magnificent, so
handsome, so liberal. His dress, his manners, his
<i>cortége</i>, all were perfect. He seemed like a prince
out of a fairy tale, just arrived from the moon, who
spoke nothing but diamonds and rubies, and at whose
feet flowers sprung up. All the ladies lost their hearts
to him, the husbands shut themselves up in a rage,
and the lovers hanged themselves in sheer despair!</p>

<p class="i1">"He soon saw how matters stood with the poor
Queen. She dared scarcely open her mouth, and
looked so terrified in the presence of her husband
and Cardinal Richelieu, that what with her beauty
and her evident sufferings, she might have touched
a heart of stone. Now the Beau Buckingham was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
far from having a heart of stone where the ladies
were concerned. So, <i>le voilà amoureux</i>, the Beau
Buckingham! Indeed, from the first moment he
came to Court he saw only the Queen. To her all
his looks, all his attentions, were directed,—and such
looks, such devotion! <i>Bon Dieu</i>, how well I remember
him in a justaucorps of white satin embroidered
with gold, leaning against a pillar gazing
at the Queen, who evidently was aware of his glances.
His long beautiful hair streamed over his shoulders
in rich chestnut curls, his noble face beamed with
expression; in one hand was a cavalier's hat covered
with snowy plumes, the other was placed on his heart.</p>

<p class="i1">"The Queen was sensible to his homage. Poor
Queen! she really was very ill used; it must have
been delightful to be loved at last. Indeed, it was
quite evident to me, as well as to the whole Court,
that Buckingham's feeling was returned. Sometimes
she gazed also, nor did her looks want fire. But,
mesdames, I hope you do not misunderstand me,"
and the Duchess glanced deprecatingly round the
circle; "I assure you I am not censorious; I am
only relating facts, undoubted facts, which happened
long ago—in order to convince you all that Madame
de Sennécy is mistaken, and that even when young
her Majesty was eminently cautious. She is so
still. Believe me, she is not married to Mazarin."</p>

<p class="i1">"Pray proceed, dear Duchess," cries Madame de
Sennécy; "never mind Mazarin; your story is most
interesting."</p>

<p class="i1">"We want to hear the <i>dénouement</i>," say all the
ladies, and the red-nosed Countess opines that "it
is easy to understand what that will be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Her Majesty used to delight in dancing. Now
she often danced with Buckingham. This was only
etiquette, as he represented Charles I. of England
at the Court of France. Her Majesty was always
very cautious, I assure you, very cautious. Buckingham
did all he could to retard the negotiation of
marriage, and Richelieu, who knew the Queen well
and had watched her closely, having, I suppose, discovered
her secret, did everything, on the contrary,
to hasten his departure.</p>

<p class="i1">"There was a story about some diamonds—an
aigrette, I believe. I never quite understood it,
ladies, but of course Madame de Chevreuse did—some
diamonds that the King had given to the
Queen, and which she gave to Buckingham, who
was imprudent enough to wear them in public.
This nearly caused her ruin, for she was surrounded
by enemies and spies. The Cardinal got wind of it,
and informed the King, and his Majesty called on
the Queen to wear these diamonds on a certain day,
and but for the exertions of certain musketeers of
the Queen's Guard, by name Athos, Porthos, and
Aramis, who journeyed night and day to fetch them
from England—at least, so goes the tale—Anne of
Austria would have been imprisoned, or perhaps
beheaded, <i>à la mode Anglaise</i>, particularly as the
Cardinal preferred that mode of execution. You
remember that charming Monsieur le Grand, who
had his head cut off?" says Madame de Noailles,
appealing to the red-nosed Countess.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah! I should think so, the husband of Marion
de l'Orme, the Marquis de Cinq-Mars, a sad profligate
and coxcomb, who richly deserved his fate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"At last Buckingham was to go," continues the
Duchess; "he could spin out his time no longer.
All the Court accompanied him to Amiens. Madame
de Chevreuse was with the Queen, who did all she
could to conceal her grief, for, believe me, she is
very cautious. Ah! her Majesty knows what it is
to be in love though, spite of caution and serge
gown, and her <i>petit air dévot</i>. She ought to be
more charitable, and let her ladies do as they please,
eh, mesdames?" and the Duchess looks round, and
sees every eye fixed eagerly upon her; the red-nosed
Countess, with a visible sneer on her face, and
Madame de Sennécy, full of gratified spite, smiling
sarcastically. "Madame de Chevreuse did, ladies,
hint to me, that the long evening spent at Amiens
was not passed—hum!—well, not passed <i>all</i> in public.
For a single moment her Majesty did, extraordinary
to say, forget her usual caution, and you
know, ladies, a moment may do much."</p>

<p class="i1">All the ladies laugh behind their fans, and the
red-nosed Countess gives it as her decided opinion
"that the Queen is not married to Mazarin," for
which the Duchesse de Sennécy warmly applauds
her excellent judgment, and adds, "she had always
said so."</p>

<p class="i1">"There was a fête at Amiens," continues Madame
de Noailles, her eyes sparkling with malice, "a shady
garden, and a moon not too bright—a lover's moon,
we will say—revealing much, not all. It is certain
that by the management of Madame de Chevreuse,
the Queen and Buckingham had a charming little
<i>àpart</i> during the fête, in a grove at the end of the
gardens, near the city walls. There was a cry, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Putange, who was in waiting, but—instructed by
Madame de Chevreuse—standing apart, though
within call, hearing the Queen's voice, rushed forward
and found her nearly fainting, and Buckingham on
his knees before her."</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Bagatelle!</i>" breaks in Madame de Sennécy,
"what a romantic story!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Certain it is, Buckingham sailed from France that
same night. Madame de Chevreuse had too much
on her own hands (<i>en fait d'amour</i>) to know more
than what Putange told her. Buckingham sailed,
the Queen returned ill to Paris, and was nursed by
the Duchesse de Chevreuse. Some say that Buckingham
returned again privately. At all events, the
Queen, as long as Richelieu and Louis XIII. lived,
led a miserable life. Mesdames," and the Duchesse
de Noailles gives a triumphant glance round the
circle, "I have proved, I think, that her Majesty is
seldom incautious," and the Duchess smiles a bitter
smile, and again looks around for approval and acquiescence.</p>

<p class="i1">Just as the ladies had all risen with great animation
to give their various opinions and to thank the
Duchess, the rattle of a heavy coach is heard
below. In a few moments the door is flung open,
and Madame la Duchesse de Chevreuse is announced.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MADAME DE NOAILLES rises to receive
the Duchesse de Chevreuse, and kisses her
with effusion, but is startled at the sight of her
blanched face and despondent air. She is plainly
dressed in a dark travelling costume, bows to the
Duchesse de Sennécy and to the other ladies, and
sinks down on a couch.</p>

<p class="i1">"Good heavens! what is the matter?" asks Madame
de Noailles, with intense curiosity, taking her
by the hand; "you are strangely altered since I left
the palace a few hours since."</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Chevreuse glances at the circle
of ladies, the "nineteen bosom friends," whose eyes
are riveted upon her as if to read her thoughts. The
red-nosed Countess in particular has advanced close
to her, in order not to lose a syllable; her mouth is
wide open, to assist her ears in listening.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have come on private business of some importance
to myself, dear Duchess," says Madame de
Chevreuse, speaking under her breath. "I did not
know that you received this evening. It is unfortunate."</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Noailles, who is dying to hear what
she has to say, looks at her guests with an unmistakable
expression. The Duchesse de Sennécy rises
at once.</p>

<p class="i1">"Allow me to wish you good evening, my dear
friend," says she, and departs. The red-nosed Countess
is forced to rise and follow her example, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
much against her will it is plain to see; the other
ladies retire with her.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Noailles and the Duchesse de Chevreuse
are now alone. Madame de Chevreuse heaves
a profound sigh; a tear rolls down her cheek, out of
which the dimples are faded. Her thin lips are white,
and she shivers.</p>

<p class="i1">"Tell me, Duchess, what misfortune has happened?"
asks Madame de Noailles, taking her hand.</p>

<p class="i1">"A misfortune, yes, for I love her—I love her
dearly. I have devoted my life to serve her; without
me she would not now be Regent of France."</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Chevreuse speaks in broken sentences;
her looks are wild; her mind seems to wander; her
large prominent eyes are fixed on vacancy.</p>

<p class="i1">"Duchess, for God's sake rouse yourself. What
has happened? Is it the Queen?" And Madame de
Noailles wrings the hand of her friend to rouse her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes—it is the Queen," replies Madame de Chevreuse
slowly, becoming more conscious, and gazing
at her. "Her Majesty has dismissed me. I am on
my way to Tours—exiled."</p>

<p class="i1">"Gracious heaven!" exclaims Madame de Noailles;
"what ingratitude!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Duchess, I thank you for your sympathy; but, I
beseech you, say not one word against my beloved
mistress. When I entered this room it seemed to me
that sorrow had made me mad—my brain was on
fire. I am better now, and calmer. My royal mistress
may live to want me, as she has so often done
before. She may recall me. At Court—in exile—absent
or present, I am her humble and devoted
slave."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"She will want no one as long as she has Mazarin,"
says the Duchess, with a sneer.</p>

<p class="i1">"So I fear," returns Madame de Chevreuse.</p>

<p class="i1">"But what has happened since I left the palace?"
again eagerly asks Madame de Noailles.</p>

<p class="i1">"I will tell you. I have never been the same to
her Majesty since the old days, when I was banished,
after the Val de Grâce, by Richelieu. She received
me well after I returned, when she was Regent; but
I have loved her too devotedly not to feel the
difference. While, on my side, the long years that
I had spent flying over Europe to escape the machinations
of the Cardinal, had only made me more
devoted to her, the Queen—who formerly trusted
me with every thought—had grown serious, reserved,
and ascetic. I am pious enough myself,"—and a gleam
of fun passes into her weary face, and causes her eyes
to sparkle,—"I never eat meat in Lent, and always
confess at Easter. But her Majesty has become a
bigot. She was always reproving me, too, for those
little <i>agaceries</i> (vanities she called them) which no
one lives without. 'My age,' she said, 'forbade
them.' Now I only own to forty, Duchess; that is not
an age to go into a convent, and to think of nothing
but my soul. Why should I not enjoy myself a little
yet?" And her large eyes find their way to a mirror
opposite, and dwell on it with evident complacency.</p>

<p class="i1">"But the Queen reproaches everybody," returns
Madame de Noailles. "Conceive—she reprimanded
me for wearing a dress too <i>décolleté</i>."</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Chevreuse smiles faintly; for it was
indeed true that the older Madame de Noailles grew,
the lower her dresses were cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"People who hated me made the Queen believe,"
continues Madame de Chevreuse, "that I wanted to
govern her—to use her patronage. If it were so, I
should have done it long ago. It was the Princesse
de Condé who told the Queen so; she hates me.
When I assured her Majesty that it was false, she
seemed to believe me. Then came the affair of
Madame de Montbazon and the letters found in her
room, one of which she said was written by the
Duchesse de Longueville, the daughter of my enemy,
the Princesse de Condé. How could I help what
my stepmother said?—she is a spoilt beauty, and
very injudicious—but her Majesty blamed me, nevertheless.
I implored her to forgive my stepmother;
and for this purpose, I offered her Majesty yesterday
a collation in those fine gardens, kept by Regnard,
beyond the chestnut avenue of the Tuileries—you
know these gardens, Duchess?"</p>

<p class="i1">"I do," replies Madame de Noailles.</p>

<p class="i1">"Her Majesty had often wished to go there. I
asked my stepmother to be present, in the full belief
that the Queen's kind heart would relent when she
saw her, and that she would restore her to favour.
Alas! I was mistaken. I do not know the Queen
now, she is so changed. She came accompanied by
the Princesse de Condé. No sooner had she set
eyes on Madame de Montbazon, who was conversing
with me, than the Queen gave me a furious glance,
called the Princesse de Condé to her side, and bid
her command the attendance of her pages; then,
without another word, her Majesty turned her back
on me, entered her coach, and departed."</p>

<p class="i1">"Heavens!" exclaims Madame de Noailles, turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
up her eyes, "no one is safe, unless they are
allies of Cardinal Mazarin."</p>

<p class="i1">"An hour afterwards,"—and the Duchesse de
Chevreuse raises her handkerchief to her eyes,—"I
received an order to quit Paris for Tours. Alas, I
have not deserved it!"</p>

<p class="i1">"It is the Cardinal," cries Madame de Noailles.
"He will drive out all her old friends; they are inconvenient——"</p>

<p class="i1">While she speaks the door opens, and Mademoiselle
de Hautefort enters the saloon, unannounced.
She is bathed in tears; her eyes are swollen with excessive
weeping; she cannot repress her sobs. The
two ladies rise, and endeavour to sooth her; but her
passionate sorrow is not to be appeased. For some
time she cannot utter a word. Madame de Chevreuse
hung over her affectionately.</p>

<p class="i1">"Dearest friend," she says, kissing her, "I guess
what has happened. You are exiled; so am I.
Come with me into Touraine; let us comfort each
other until better days."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, speak not to me of better days," sobs
Mademoiselle de Hautefort. "They can never
come to me. My dear, dear mistress, you have
broken my heart!" and she bursts into a fresh passion
of tears.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Chevreuse sits down beside her
and chafes her hand. Madame de Noailles, who
sees in the departure of these two ladies a chance of
greater promotion and increased confidence for herself,
forms her countenance into an expression of
concern she does not in the least feel.</p>

<p class="i1">"My dear friend," says Madame de Chevreuse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
endeavouring to calm the agony of grief which
shook the whole frame of Mademoiselle de Hautefort,
"let us share our sorrow."</p>

<p class="i1">"The Queen must think herself rich in friends, to
cast away such devoted servants," observes Madame
de Noailles sententiously, contemplating the group
through her eye-glass. "Do speak, Mademoiselle
de Hautefort."</p>

<p class="i1">She had gradually become more collected, and her
violent sobs had ceased; but now and then her
bosom heaves, as bitter recollections of the past float
through her mind.</p>

<p class="i1">"Speak," whispers the Duchesse de Chevreuse in
her softest voice, "it will relieve you. In what
manner did our royal mistress dismiss you?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Late last evening," answers Mademoiselle de
Hautefort, in a tremulous voice, stopping every now
and then to sigh, and to wipe the tears that streamed
from her eyes. "Mademoiselle de Motteville and I
were assisting the Queen at her <i>coucher</i>. As is our
habit we were conversing familiarly with her. The
Queen was undressed, and just preparing to get into
bed. She had only her last prayer to say, for she
lives on prayer, like a true saint." Madame de
Noailles draws down the corners of her mouth and
scarcely endeavours to hide her derision. Even the
Duchesse de Chevreuse smiles. "Mademoiselle de
Motteville and her sister the Comtesse de Jars, and
Mademoiselle de Beaumont, had just left the anteroom
from whence they had been speaking with the
Queen. I was on my knees before her taking off
her shoes. All at once I remembered that a gentleman,
who attends upon the ladies in waiting, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Nédo, a Breton—you know him, Duchess?"—Madame
de Chevreuse answered that she did,—"had
asked me to obtain a better appointment for him."
Mademoiselle de Hautefort pauses. The scene
seems to rise before her, and a fresh fit of violent
sobbing prevents her from speaking. "Alas!" she
exclaims at last, "why—why did I presume to
trouble her Majesty for such a trifle? A stranger
to me, too! I have lost what was dearer to me than
life—herself. She refused me," continues Mademoiselle
de Hautefort, "I was nettled. Oh, Duchess,"
says she, turning to Madame de Chevreuse, "how
often have you borne my hasty temper! How I
reproach myself now! That temper has ruined—undone
me!"</p>

<p class="i1">"What would Monsieur le Maréchal de Schomberg
say if he heard you?" asks Madame de Noailles
slily.</p>

<p class="i1">"Do not name him to me," cries Mademoiselle de
Hautefort impatiently. "Schomberg is nothing to
me in comparison with the Queen. Had I remained
with her, I could never, never have married!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, you will now," and the Duchess laughs.
"But what happened? Do go on."</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas! I lost my temper. I was irritated at her
Majesty refusing me so small a favour. I told her
she had forgotten the claims of her old friends, who
had suffered so much in her service."</p>

<p class="i1">"That was wrong, ungenerous," interposes Madame
de Chevreuse. "A favour ceases to be a
favour, if it be made a subject of reproach; besides——"</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah! I know it too well!" and Mademoiselle de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Hautefort almost groans with anguish; "and it is
that which breaks my heart; it is my own fault.
The Queen, in one moment, became more excited
than I had ever seen her. Her face turned crimson,
she threw herself on her bed, commanded me to
close the curtains, and to retire. I disobeyed her.
I could not help it. I cast myself on the ground
within the <i>ruelle</i> of her bed. I clasped my hands.
I told her I called God to witness of my love, my
devotion to her. I implored her to recall the past,
to remember his Majesty Louis XIII."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah! you were very wrong," exclaims Madame
de Chevreuse; "most impolitic, most undutiful.
You have a good heart, mademoiselle, but you are
too impulsive."</p>

<p class="i1">"It is true," answers Mademoiselle de Hautefort,
humbly. "Her Majesty grew more and more displeased,
she said that she must have me know she
would allow no one about her who did not love and
respect her; then she went on to say that I had
made observations upon her valued servant, Cardinal
Mazarin, which were very displeasing to her. I
replied too hastily that it was my care for her honour
that had made me do so; that reports were circulating
injurious to her, and that I longed to see
the departure of a minister whose presence compromised
her."</p>

<p class="i1">"What imprudence!" cries Madame de Chevreuse,
lifting up her hands. "How could you dare
to say this?"</p>

<p class="i1">"It is quite true, however," rejoins Madame de
Noailles, "and it was the part of a true friend to tell
her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Would to God I had been silent!" continues
Mademoiselle de Hautefort; "no sooner were the
words out of my mouth than the Queen sternly ordered
me to extinguish the lights and to withdraw.
I rose from my knees more dead than alive and departed.
When I awoke this morning I received an
order commanding me not to approach within forty
miles of the Court. Oh, it is dreadful!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Come with me into Touraine, my carriage
waits below. We will stop at your lodgings in
order to give your people time to pack. Come,
dear friend, we have lived side by side among the
splendours of the court, we have suffered persecution
for the same mistress, we love her devotedly,
spite of all injuries. Let us now comfort each other
in exile."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle de Hautefort casts herself into the
arms of the Duchess.</p>

<p class="i1">"You will not keep her long," observes Madame
de Noailles, with a smile, "we shall soon see her back
at Court, as Madame la Marèchale de Schomberg,
more blooming than ever."</p>

<p class="i1">"No, no," sobs Mademoiselle de Hautefort.
"Never!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Adieu, Madame," says the Duchesse de Chevreuse,
saluting Madame de Noailles, and taking
Mademoiselle de Hautefort by the hand. "Excuse
our abrupt departure, but the sooner we quit Paris
the better. My friend and I would desire in all
things to obey her Majesty's pleasure. Let us hope
to meet in happier days. <i>Ma chère</i>," adds she more
gaily, addressing the maid of honour, "we shall not
die of <i>ennui</i> at my château."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle de Hautefort only replies with sobs.
The idea of departing overcame her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Some gentlemen of our acquaintance will attend
us."</p>

<p class="i1">"How like the Duchess! She cannot exist without
lovers," mutters Madame de Noailles, to herself.
Meanwhile she attended the two ladies to the head
of the staircase, with great apparent affection, kissing
them on both cheeks. She watched their departure
from a window and waved her hand to them, affecting
to weep.</p>

<p class="i1">"What a relief they are gone!" she exclaims,
taking out her watch. "<i>Ma foi</i>, how long they have
stayed! It is time for me to dress for the Queen's
circle. Now they are gone, there is no one in my way
at Court. I am sure of favour—perhaps of confidence.
Her Majesty must unbosom herself to some one;
why not to me? In half an hour I must be at the
palace," and she rang and ordered her coach.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Chevreuse was never again called
to the side of Anne of Austria. Her hatred of Cardinal
Mazarin forbade it. She became one of the
principal leaders of that "Ladies' Battle," the
Fronde.</p>

<p class="i1">Nor was Mademoiselle de Hautefort ever forgiven
her bluntness on the Queen's very equivocal behaviour.
As Marèchale de Schomberg, however, she
reappeared at Court, but found Anne of Austria lost
to her for ever.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Noailles wore dresses cut in
accordance with her Majesty's taste. Although she
never became the Queen's confidante, for many years
she held a high station at Court.</p>

<p class="ac">CHARLES STUART.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-l.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap L" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">LOUISE DE MONTPENSIER—only daughter
of Gaston, Duc d'Orléans, second son of
Henry IV. and of Marie de Bourbon-Montpensier—was,
as has been said, the greatest heiress in
Europe. Her girlhood was passed with Anne of
Austria. When Louis XIV. was born the Queen
called her <i>ma fille</i>. When Mademoiselle romped
with the boy-king, she addressed him as <i>mon mari</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">In spite of the long nose of the Bourbons, <i>la
Grande Mademoiselle</i>, as she was called, was fairly
good looking. She was tall and shapely, with
regular features, a good skin, finely cut blue eyes,
pencilled eyebrows, a large, though well-formed
mouth, and good teeth. Flowing ringlets of light
hair framed her face and fell over her rounded
shoulders. She had, moreover, an unmistakable air
of command.</p>

<p class="i1">Her character may be best described in negatives.
She was not a heroine, although circumstances made
her appear one. She understood politics, but had
little capacity for a ruler. She had no fortitude,
although possessing a certain elevation of character
that lifted her above commonplace. She was selfish
and cold-hearted, yet capable of warm attachments.
She was ostentatious in the use of her great wealth,
but not charitable. She was blinded by conceit,
yet was not wanting in shrewdness and judgment.
She was haughty, yet loved to condescend to the
populace. She was excessively ridiculous, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
affected extreme dignity. Whatever advantages
she possessed were but too well known to herself.
Of her faults—and they were many—she was entirely
ignorant. Placed between two parties, the Queen
and the Fronde, she was courted by both, and grew
headstrong and ambitious in consequence. Although
she ardently desired to marry her cousin Louis XIV.,
she went out of her way to offend, nay, even to outrage
him. Yet unconscious of all her follies, to the
day of her death she firmly believed she was by
wealth, position, and genius raised upon a pedestal
which all Europe contemplated with admiring curiosity.
Every crowned bachelor within the civilised
world, according to her, sought her hand in
marriage.</p>

<p class="i1">After the defeat at Worcester, Charles Stuart
escaped to the Continent. His mother had already
fled to France. Poor Henrietta Maria (wrinkled, and
prematurely old, with tear-furrowed cheeks, and dull,
hollow eyes, her fragrant curls, so often painted by
Vandyke, grown grey, her royal carriage bowed by
the weight of adversity) lived with her young daughter
Henriette, afterwards Duchesse d'Orléans, sister-in-law
of Louis XIV., at the Louvre, in right of her
birth as <i>Fille de France</i>. For a time this Queen of
Shadows, the relict of a defunct monarchy, bore the
splendour of her former state. But one by one her
ladies in waiting, grooms of the chamber, maids of
honour, footmen, chamberlains, and pages disappeared.
At last she grew too poor even to procure
sufficient fuel to keep out the winter cold. Though
living in a palace, she was glad, with the young princess
her daughter, to lie in bed for the sake of warmth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle patronised this afflicted relative, and
frequently visited her. But she does not appear to
have ministered to her necessities. Henrietta was
resigned, even humble to the exalted princess, her
niece; and dwelt often on the personal charms of her
eldest son, Charles Stuart.</p>

<p class="i1">She painted him with a brush dipped in the
roseate colours of a mother's fancy. He was, she
said, brave, gallant, handsome, witty, accomplished.
He had splendid black hair, a rich complexion, as of
one much exposed to battles and an adventurous life,
and the bearing of a Paladin. He would be certain
to crush his enemies, and sit upon his father's throne,
she told her niece. But the wily heiress, while she
listened to the eager gossip of the broken-hearted
Queen, was preoccupied by a matrimonial intrigue
carried on by a certain Abbé de la Rivière, to make
her Empress of Germany.</p>

<p class="i1">"I perfectly understood my aunt's drift," she says;
"but I liked the Emperor better."</p>

<p class="i1">When Charles Stuart, having escaped almost by a
miracle from England, arrived at Fontainebleau,
where the Court was staying, he was presented to
Mademoiselle by his mother. Charles saluted her as
a cousin and a friend, saluted her in dumb show, however,
for he could speak no French. The exiled
Queen, therefore (already grasping in anticipation
the revenues of the principalities, dukedoms, forests,
and castles of her wealthy niece), set herself to act
interpreter.</p>

<p class="i1">Charles Stuart had a melting eye and a manly
presence. He dallied with his cousin, sat beside her
when she played, led her to her coach, held the flambeau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
while she adjusted her dress, was again found at
her door—having run on in front—to assist her to
descend, and generally ogled, languished, gazed, and
sighed, to the very utmost of his power. But a dumb
lover is dull, and love-making by proxy never answers.
<i>La Grande Mademoiselle</i>, already in imagination invested
with the diadem of an Empress, did not fancy
a prince who was only an exile, and who could not
even plead his own cause. She looked on him as a
bore—indeed, worse than a bore, an object of pity.</p>

<p class="i1">The Queen of England tried hard to melt her
heart. She even coaxed her; with her own hands she
decked her soft hair with jewels for her Majesty's
ballet. She flattered her into a belief that she was
as beautiful as Venus. She declared that Charles
Stuart's heart was breaking, that his health suffered,
that he would die. No mother ever served a son
better than did this poor distracted lady. But there
was her son, with his swarthy, hard face, as strong
and hale as an oak sapling, his wanton black eye
wandering over the belles of the French Court,—a
living contradiction to all she said! At last, Charles
Stuart, who cared less for the well-filled purse and
boundless dominions of his cousin than his mother,
who knew what it was to be pinched with cold and
hunger, grew impatient, and insisted on an answer.
He sent Lord St. Germains to Mademoiselle to say
that he was so passionately in love with her, he could
no longer bear suspense. Mademoiselle replied with
the discretion of a maiden, and the judgment of an
heiress, conscious that she was dealing with a royal
fortune-hunter—</p>

<p class="i1">"The Prince of Wales did her great honour, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
as she understood that he required much pecuniary
assistance to recover the Crown of England, his birthright,
she feared she might find herself overwhelmed
with expenses incompatible with the wants of a person
of her exalted rank. That she must, in consequence,
make sacrifices and adopt resolutions difficult
to contemplate. That she might risk the loss of her
entire possessions on the chance of Charles's re-conquering
his kingdom; and that, having been educated
in splendour as one of the greatest princesses in the
world, the prospect alarmed her."</p>

<p class="i1">Yet there must have been some charm about the
hard-featured, stalwart youth that attracted her; she
would not say, "No." In order to throw down a
bait, she hinted that she desired him to change his
religion.</p>

<p class="i1">"Impossible, madame," was the reply of Lord St.
Germains. "A king of England cannot change his
religion. He would exclude himself for ever from
the throne!"</p>

<p class="i1">Again, however, Charles was permitted to approach
her, and to make a last attempt. She relished
a little mild flirtation with an exiled King, although
she vastly preferred marriage with an Emperor.
Nevertheless, she curled her hair in honour of the
occasion, a thing not usual with her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, look at her!" said the Queen-Regent, when
she appeared in the evening: "it is easy to see she
is expecting a lover. See!—how she is decked out!"</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle blushed, but was too discreet to
commit herself by a single word.</p>

<p class="i1">When Charles Stuart entered the Queen's saloon
he looked provokingly well. His mother, nervously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
alive to every trifle, felt this. A man with such a
constitution was not adapted to play the part of a
despairing lover. When questioned by the Queen
about his affairs in England, he replied that he knew
nothing. Mademoiselle instantly formed a bad opinion
of him. She turned to her lady in waiting, Madame
de Fiesque, and whispered—</p>

<p class="i1">"He is too much of a Bourbon for me. Quite
engrossed by trifles" (<i>the race has not changed</i>).
"He can talk about dogs and horses and the chase
to her Majesty, but he has nothing to say about the
revolution in England."</p>

<p class="i1">Later in the evening, at the royal table, Mademoiselle
was shocked at Charles's coarse appetite.
He despised ortolans and Italian pastry, and threw
himself upon a joint of beef. Not satisfied with that,
he ended by a shoulder of mutton. "A despairing
lover ought not to have such a monstrous appetite,
or he should satisfy the cravings of hunger beforehand,"
thought Mademoiselle. He stared fixedly at
her, with his big black eyes shaded by heavy eyebrows,
while he was shovelling huge pieces of meat
down his throat, but he never spoke. Truly this
was not a fashion of pushing his suit with a fastidious
princess who desired to be an empress!</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle yawned, looked at him under her
eyelids, shrugged her shapely shoulders, and called
her lady in waiting to her side to amuse her. Thus
passed the precious moments which were to decide
the momentous question—would she, or would she
not?</p>

<p class="i1">At length, having gorged in a prodigious manner,
Charles Stuart rose. He made Mademoiselle a formal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
bow, and opened his mouth to speak for the
first time. "I hope," he said, in very bad French,
"my Lord St. Germains has explained to your highness
the sentiments with which you have inspired
me. I am, madame, your very humble servant."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle rose to her feet, made him a formal
curtsey, and replied, "Sir, I am your very humble
servant."</p>

<p class="i1">So ended this wooing; but poor Henrietta Maria,
figuratively rending her clothes and sprinkling ashes
on her head at such a conclusion, could not let
Mademoiselle off without one Parthian shot. "I
see," said she, "my son is too poor and too unfortunate
for you, my niece. It is quite possible, however,
that a king of eighteen may be better worth
having than an elderly emperor with four children."
This little ebullition of spite is pardonable in an
unfortunate Queen whose heart was broken. Let it
not lie heavy on her memory!</p>

<p class="i1">Meanwhile, the struggle between the Queen-Regent
and her ministers on one side, and the parliament
and Gondi on the other, had become more and
more envenomed. At length the Queen-Regent,
under advice of Mazarin, resolved by a <i>coup d'état</i> to
restore the royal authority.</p>

<p class="i1">It is Twelfth-night. Anne of Austria is spending
the evening in her closet, watching the King and his
brother, the Duc d'Anjou—both dressed in character—struggle
on the floor over the remains of the cake
from which they had dug the "bean" and the
"ring." Louis XIV. is a handsome boy, docile yet
spirited; Philip of Anjou is puny, peevish, and
cowardly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Anne of Austria leans against the back of a chair,
and watches the two boys. Her ladies watch her.
There is a strange rumour that her Majesty is to
leave Paris that very night. To look into her placid
face, such an idea seems absurd. By-and-by, Mazarin
and some of the princes of the blood come in to
ask her pleasure for the morrow. They do not remain,
as there is a supper at the Maréchal de Grammont's
in honour of the day. When they are gone,
the Queen turns to Madame de la Trémouille.</p>

<p class="i1">"I shall go to-morrow to the Val de Grâce. Give
orders that everything may be ready for me. Call
Beringhen; it is time for his Majesty and the Duke
to go to bed."</p>

<p class="i1">The King at once comes forward to bid his mother
good night. The Duke begins to cry.</p>

<p class="i1">"What is it, my son?" says the Queen.</p>

<p class="i1">"I want, Madame, to go with you to the Val de
Grâce to-morrow—do let me!" and he kneels and
kisses her hand.</p>

<p class="i1">"If I go, my son, I promise to take you. Now,
good night, Philip," and she raises him in her
arms, and kisses him; "do not keep his Majesty
waiting."</p>

<p class="i1">She retires early. Those ladies who do not sleep
at the Palais Royal leave, and the gates are closed.</p>

<p class="i1">At three o'clock in the morning, Mademoiselle de
Montpensier, at the Palace of the Luxembourg, is
awakened by a violent knocking. She rouses her
women, and orders them to see who is there. It is
a messenger from the Queen.</p>

<p class="i1">"Let him enter," says Mademoiselle, speaking
from her bed. It is well to say that Mademoiselle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
was entirely concealed by heavy curtains, and that
the bed stood in a deep alcove.</p>

<p class="i1">"The Captain of the Queen's Guard awaits your
highness's pleasure," calls out Monsieur de Comminges,
from the door.</p>

<p class="i1">"What has brought you here at this time of night,
Comminges?" asks Mademoiselle from her bed.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Highness, the Court is leaving Paris
secretly. Her Majesty commands your attendance.
Here is a letter which will explain the Queen's
wishes.</p>

<p class="i1">"Monsieur de Comminges," replies Mademoiselle,—who
at that time had not conceived the possibility
of being one of the <i>à la mode</i> leaders of the Fronde,
and pointing the guns of the Bastille against her
cousin, the King—putting the letter under her pillow,
"the commands of her Majesty are sufficient
for me. I need no letter to enforce them. Retire,
Monsieur le Capitaine, into the anteroom. I will
rise instantly, and accompany you. But tell me,
Monsieur de Comminges,"—calling after him—"where
are we to go to?"</p>

<p class="i1">"To Saint-Germain en Laye, your highness."</p>

<p class="i1">In a short time Mademoiselle is ready. Without
waiting for her women, or what she calls her "equipage"
(which she desired to have sent after her), she
goes out into the night accompanied by Monsieur
de Comminges, whose coach waits without. It was
pitch dark, but with the help of a flambeau they
traverse the unpaved and ill-lit streets, and reach
the garden entrance of the Palais Royal without
accident. There they find another coach drawn up
under some trees. Within sits Anne of Austria;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the two princes are each in a corner—Louis XIV.
very sleepy and cross, the Duc d'Anjou crying.
Mademoiselle is instantly transferred into the royal
coach.</p>

<p class="i1">"Are you frightened, my cousin?" asks the Queen,
speaking out of the darkness to Mademoiselle.</p>

<p class="i1">"Not in the least, Madame," is her reply. "I will
follow your Majesty anywhere," and she takes her
place opposite to her in the coach.</p>

<p class="i1">It is a long and weary drive to Saint-Germain.
When they arrive it is breakfast time. But the
Queen commands every creature, including her children,
into the chapel to hear mass. As soon as they
had time to look round, they find the palace (a dreary,
gaunt edifice at all times) cold and wretched beyond
description in a dark January morning. The rooms
are entirely empty—Mazarin having made no provision
for the Queen's arrival, out of fear, perhaps,
that her flight might become known. There are
neither beds, furniture, nor linen. There is not a
servant or attendant of any kind but such as have
accompanied them. When it is night the Queen
lies down to rest on a little camp bedstead. The
King and his brother fare no better. Mademoiselle
is accommodated with a straw mattress in a magnificent
saloon on the third floor. There were plenty of
mirrors and much gilding, and the windows were
lofty, and commanded an extensive view, but there
is not a single pane of glass in one of them! No
one has a change of linen. What was worn by night
was washed by day. The Queen laughs at everything.
She says—"It is an escapade which will at
most last three days; when the citizens find that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Court has left the Palais Royal they will speedily
come to their senses."</p>

<p class="ac">THE LADIES' WAR.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the citizens of Paris find that the Court
had left the Palais Royal, instead of coming
to their senses, they were furious. The Coadjutor,
who had broken with the Regent, ruled supreme.
He skilfully availed himself of the crisis, and caused
the parliament to pass the act against aliens. This
measure outlawed Mazarin as an enemy of the King
and of the State, a conspirator, a perjurer, and a thief;
confiscated his possessions, and enjoined all faithful
subjects to shoot him without trial.</p>

<p class="i1">Civil war breaks out. The troops of the Queen-Regent
were but feebly attacked. It was the <i>hearts</i>
of her generals that were vigorously assailed by the
lady commandants of the Fronde, whose artillery
was blandishments and enticements.</p>

<p class="i1">Every soul in Paris armed himself, and took the
field in whatever costume he usually wore. The
nobles led the way in feathered hats, satin doublets,
silk stockings, and high-heeled boots. No one knew
what they were fighting for. The cry was, "<i>Vive la
Fronde!</i>" "<i>Mort à Mazarin!</i>"</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Longueville, supported by her
brother, the great Condé, took possession of the
executive government at the Hôtel de Ville. She was
quickly joined by the Duchesses de Chevreuse and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
de Montbazon. The Duc de Beaufort was set at
liberty. But as it was quite a "Ladies' War," he
acted only as subordinate. The Duchesses distributed
all the military posts and honours among themselves—they
created themselves generals, lieutenants,
and colonels, like so many Bellonas. War was waged
on quite new principles: Maréchal d'Hocquincourt,
defending Peronne for the Queen-Regent, assured
the Duchesse de Montbazon, who invested it for the
Fronde, "That Peronne was at the service of the
fairest of the fair."</p>

  <div class="caption">DUCHESSE DE LONGUEVILLE.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Not so <i>la Grande Mademoiselle</i>. She ranged herself
on the popular side against the Court, and commanded
at the Bastille. She fought in good earnest,
and pointed the well-loaded guns of that fortress
against her King and cousin, who, with his army,
lay encamped without the walls of Paris. Louis
retreated precipitately to Saint-Denis.</p>

<p class="i1">We are in the Hôtel de Ville, within the apartment
of one of the very prettiest aides-de-camp attached to
the Duchesse de Longueville. This fair lady, Mademoiselle
de Rosny, has just finished a most elaborate
toilette, and having arranged the innumerable little
curls (then so much in vogue) round her face, and
fastened the proper quantity of ribbon in her dark
locks, takes a last fond look in the glass, and then
seats herself in the happiest possible state of expectation.
Now there is a certain all-conquering beau—Monsieur
d'Aumale by name—who has more than
half achieved the conquest of her heart; and she has
a kind of presentiment that the morning will not
pass without a visit from this pearl of cavaliers. Nor
is she mistaken: a soft knock at her door announces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the approach of some one. How her heart beats!
It must be M. d'Aumale! So she says "<i>Entrez!</i>"
in a trembling voice, and D'Aumale stands before
her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Mademoiselle de Rosny," he exclaims, "I am
in the utmost haste, I am come to beg you to be
present at the most singular spectacle you ever
beheld!"</p>

<p class="i1">"What may it be?" replies she, rather chagrined
that instead of a tender love-scene, such as she anticipated,
M. d'Aumale seems so preoccupied.</p>

<p class="i1">"It is but a review, mademoiselle, ordered by the
council; but, ha! ha! such a review! <i>Morbleu</i>, you
will never guess of whom—the oddest idea! It is
no other than a review of priests, monks, and seminarists,
all sword in hand, and ready to charge the
enemy. It is the strangest idea of defence that ever
was conceived; but as we have lady-generals, and
the <i>Grande Mademoiselle</i> for commander-in-chief, we
are now to have an army of priests for them to lead
to battle. Those tonsured recruits are actually now
all assembling on the bridge near Notre-Dame. You
must be quick."</p>

<p class="i1">"Was ever anything so ridiculous!" and Mademoiselle
de Rosny laughs. "But I shall be terrified
at their awkwardness; they will be sure to fire too
low and hit us."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, but you must come. I will be your guard;
I pledge myself that you shall return uninjured," and
D'Aumale gives the lady a tender glance. "Besides,
to reassure you, I believe that these monk-warriors
are not even to be trusted with matches; the arquebuses
and cannon are as empty and as innocent as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
when in the arsenal; so there is nothing to fear. If
you will come, I will conduct you in my new coach—the
very model of elegance—I will answer for it
there is not such another in all Paris."</p>

<p class="i1">"That will be delightful!" cries the lady. "I do
admire those new coaches so much, if it were not for
this abominable war, I suppose they would become
universal. Well, Monsieur d'Aumale, I am ready!
let us see these monks; it will be a good story with
which to entertain Madame la Duchesse de Longueville
this evening at her reception. How the Duc de
Beaufort will laugh!"</p>

<p class="i1">In high glee Mademoiselle de Rosny departed,
accompanied by her admirer, her pleasure not a little
heightened by the idea of appearing in a coach, then
by no means common in Paris, and reserved generally
for royalty, or for grand occasions, or state
processions—heavy lumbering vehicles, such as figure
in the old prints of that period, with a sloping roof
like a house, and drawn by Flemish horses of huge
dimensions. On arriving near the bridge, they stop
under the shadow of the Cathedral, and there behold
the most extraordinary spectacle. All the young
monks in Paris are crowded near Notre-Dame, with
the exception of the Benedictines and some other
orders, who refused to take any part in this mummery.
At least fifteen hundred ecclesiastics, drawn
up in excellent order, are executing the various
manœuvres of march, halt, right-about face, etc.,
with tolerable precision. The greater number have
fastened up their black robes, and invested their
lower limbs with most uncanonical garments. The
reverend fathers, with their hoods hanging over their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
shoulders, are booted and spurred, many wear helmets
and cuirasses, and all carry such halberts,
lances, swords, and bucklers as they had been able to
lay hands on. Others grasp a crucifix in one hand,
and in the other a pistol, a scythe, an old dagger or
a knife, with which each intends to perform prodigies
of valour against the enemies of the Fronde. As
they advance and retreat on the dusty soil in lines
and columns, they present the appearance of an immense
flight of crows hovering over a field of newly
cut wheat.</p>

<p class="i1">To this martial array is added the clamour of
drums, trumpets, and warlike instruments, accompanied
with no end of benedictions, <i>Oremus</i>, and
chanted psalms. At the head of the troops is a
bishop, metamorphosed into a commander. He
moves very slowly, by reason of his corpulence, and
the weight of the armour he wears, and looks like a
dilapidated St. George, minus the dragon. Then
come Carthusians, Begging Friars, Capuchins, and
Seminarists, each different order led by their abbot
or prior. They all advance gravely with the orthodox
goose-step. Cries of "Down with the Regent!"
"Death to Mazarin!" "<i>A bas</i> the Italian beggar!"
"Long live the Union!" "<i>Vive la Duchesse!</i>"
"<i>Vive la Fronde!</i>" add to the clamour of the martial
music and the psalms. Mademoiselle de Rosny is
fain to hold both her ears, notwithstanding all the
sweet things her companion is whispering. The
mob of Paris <i>en masse</i> is assembled to witness this
extraordinary review, and to rejoice in the unexpected
aid contributed by the Church in the general
emergency. Nor is M. d'Aumale's the only coach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
on the Quai Notre-Dame that day; many other
possessors of such vehicles have been attracted by
the scene. The Legate is among the number. The
crowd is immense, the applause enthusiastic.</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Ciel!</i>" calls out Mademoiselle de Rosny, on a
sudden. "Look—Oh, look! Monsieur d'Aumale,
you have deceived me, I am sure. They are going
to fire!"</p>

<p class="i1">"No, no," replies D'Aumale, "believe me, you are
mistaken. 'Give the monk his rosary, the soldier
his sword,' says the motto. <i>Messieurs les moines</i> will
not venture to burn their hands in attempting to
handle firearms."</p>

<p class="i1">"But I tell you," cries the lady, "they are going
to fire! Good heavens, the guns are all turned this
way! Oh, D'Aumale, we shall be murdered. Help!
help! I implore you!" And she catches hold of
him, and begins to scream after the most approved
fashion preparatory to a fit of hysterics.</p>

<p class="i1">D'Aumale looks out of the window. "In the
name of Heaven, beware—beware!" he shouts to the
priests. But in the confusion his voice is inaudible.
The ecclesiastical artillerymen, awkward and inexperienced,
have already lighted the matches, and the
cannon, which were loaded, explode right and left
in the crowd. A fearful cry arises from the Legate's
coach.</p>

<p class="i1">"Thank Heaven, D'Aumale, we have escaped,—this
time at least," gasps Mademoiselle de Rosny in
a low voice, for she is now calmed by excessive fear.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, but I fancy some one else has been seriously
wounded. I will alight and see," says D'Aumale,
unfastening the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">A dense crowd surrounds the coach belonging to
the Legate. The secretary of his eminence had
been shot dead by a bullet through the chest, the
Legate's confessor is wounded in the head, and his
two valets also much injured. Never was there
such confusion. M. d'Aumale hastens back to
secure the safe retreat of the fair De Rosny. They
are soon disengaged from the crowd, and rolling
back over the muddy ground to the Hôtel de Ville.
Here we must bid them farewell, assuming that
mademoiselle soon secured the possession of the
much-admired coach by a speedy marriage with its
handsome owner.</p>

<p class="ac">MAZARIN PLAYED OUT.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-t.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE marriage bells peal merrily for the august
espousals of Louis XIV. with the Infanta Maria
Theresa, daughter of the King of Spain. The troubles
of the Fronde are over. Gondi, the Coadjutor,
now Cardinal de Retz, is imprisoned. Cardinal
Mazarin has cemented a peace between France and
Spain. He has triumphed.</p>

<p class="i1">Mazarin left Paris with a great retinue of coaches,
litters, and mules, attended by bishops, secretaries,
lawyers, and priests, to meet the Spanish ambassador,
Don Luis Da Haro, on the frontier, there to
arrange the preliminaries of the treaty and the marriage.
Don Luis had already arrived, attended with
equal splendour. A whole month was lost in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
all-important question of precedence. Should Mazarin
call on Da Haro, or Da Haro "drop in" on
Mazarin? This momentous point was never settled.
Mazarin, the wily Italian—<i>Il Signor Faquino</i>, as the
Prince de Condé calls him—took to his bed, hoping
that the anxiety felt for his health by Da Haro would
induce him to pocket his Castilian dignity and make
the first advance. But Da Haro was not to be
caught, and obstinately shut himself up, ate, drank,
and made merry with the most dogged patience, and
the most entire want of sympathy. So it ended in
this wise—no visit was made at all. The great plenipotentiaries
met, quite unofficially, on the Island of
Pheasants, in the middle of the River Bidassoa, dividing
France and Spain. There the real business
was very soon despatched. In process of time, the
King and the Infanta were married.</p>

<p class="i1">The Infanta was very small, fair, and plump.
There was an utter absence of expression in her
freshly complexioned face; her eyes were large and
gentle, but said absolutely nothing of any soul within.
Her mouth was large, her teeth were irregular.
Her dress horrified the French ladies. It was unanimously
voted tawdry, ill-made, and unbecoming. As
for the ladies in attendance on her, it was not possible
to find words to paint their grotesqueness. They
were black-skinned, scraggy, and awkward. They
had hideous lace, and wore enormous farthingales.
One of them, the "governess of the Infanta," is gibbeted
in the pages of history as "a monster." She
unhappily wore what are designated as "<i>barrels</i>"
under her dress. Such was the first effect of <i>crinoline</i>
on the ladies of the French nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Noailles was appointed lady of
the bedchamber to the new Queen. She was recommended
to this office by the Queen-dowager, Anne
of Austria, her aunt.</p>

<p class="i1">Cardinal Mazarin has now reached the summit of
power. He has imprisoned his rival, Cardinal de
Retz, and has tranquillised a great nation. He has
even received the solemn thanks of the once turbulent
parliament. He has equalled, if not exceeded,
the renown of Richelieu. After the sounding of
those marriage bells he returns to Paris, to repose
upon his laurels. See him! the artistic egotist, who
all his life has fed on the choicest grapes from his
neighbour's vine, and sipped the most fragrant
honey from flowers not his own. See him within his
magnificent palace, the outward and visible evidence
of the enormous wealth which he no longer fears to
display. Louis XIV. looks on him as a father. Anne
of Austria trembles when he frowns. All France is
subservient to his rule. The walls of his chamber
are lined with artistic plunder:—pictures set in gorgeous
frames of Florentine carving; statues, mirrors,
and glittering chandeliers; tables and consoles bearing
ornaments of inestimable value, in marble, bronze,
porcelain, pottery, enamel, and gems. Richest hangings
of tapestry, and brocaded satin and velvet, more
costly than the gold which surrounds them, shade
the intrusive sunshine, and tone all down to that
delicious half light so dear to the artistic sense.
Everything has been arranged by the hand of a master;
and there he sits, this master, dying. The seeds of
disease, sown on the frontier where he was detained
by Da Haro, have developed into a mortal malady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">He has just risen from his bed. He reposes in a
chair on wheels, in which he is rolled from frescoed
gallery to marble vestibule; from corridors of pictures
to precious libraries; from dainty retiring-rooms to
painted pavilions, from guard-room saloon—those
superb saloons where he received the Court.</p>

<p class="i1">He even penetrates to the stables, and surveys his
priceless stud; he ventures into the magnificent gardens
which surround his palace, to feast his eyes on
all his vast possessions. Returning again, greatly
fatigued, to the picture-gallery, he bids his attendants
pause. He rests, absorbed in thought, under a
Holy Family, by Raphael, a work beyond price, now
in the Louvre. Here he desires his attendants to
leave him. His secretary, who is never beyond call,
he commands to wait his pleasure in the anteroom,
behind the thick silken hangings that veil the door.
Inadvertently this door is left ajar, and the secretary,
curious to know what his master is doing, looks
through a chink in the curtain, and watches him.
The Cardinal, when he has glanced round carefully—to
be sure he is alone—lays hold of a crutch placed
ready to his hand, and with the utmost difficulty
struggles to his feet, for they are swollen, and almost
useless from gout. After many efforts he disengages
himself from the chair, and reaches the ground, then,
balancing himself upon the crutch and any object
near at hand, he moves a few steps, stopping for
lack of breath. (The secretary doubts if he should
not rush in before he falls, so uncertain and tottering
are Mazarin's movements, but he forbears, fearful of
angering the Cardinal, whom suffering has made
irritable.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Mazarin sighs deeply as he limps on from picture
to picture, and surveys his favourite works.</p>

<p class="i1">"I feel better," he says, speaking aloud. "If I
could only get my breath, I should recover. <i>Diamine!</i>
I shall—I will recover. I cannot leave my pictures—such
a collection,"—and he turns round with difficulty,
and surveys the galleries—"not yet complete—to
pass into other hands. No, no—it cannot be;
I feel stronger already. I—alone in my gallery—without
those spies always about me to see my
weakness—I can breathe." And he draws a long
breath. The long breath ends in a groan. "That
divine Raffaello!" and again he sighs, and turns to
the gem of his collection, a Nativity. "Raffaello is
my religion. <i>Credo in Raffaello!</i> What <i>anima</i>!
That exquisite Virgin! and the Christ nestling in
her arms! I wonder who sat for that virgin? She
must have been a perfect creature! I salute her <i>di
cuore</i>. That picture came to me from the King of
Spain—a bribe. Who cares? I never refuse a present.
The King knows my taste. He sent me word there
were many more to come if I concluded a peace. I
did conclude a peace; I took that picture and others;
but <i>Sangue di Dio</i>, I was faithful to France. Ah, ha!
I was too sharp for him—a dull king! That <i>torso</i>
there, dug up at Portici—what stalwart limbs! what
grand proportions! How finely the shadows fall
upon the thigh from that passing cloud. Aha! my
foot!" (and he shakes on his crutches so violently
the secretary's head and shoulders are inside the
room, only the Cardinal does not see him). "I am
better now," falters Mazarin, "much better"; then,
taking a few steps onwards, he pauses before a Titian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
"Venus, my Goddess!—<i>Laus Veneri</i>. Oh, the
warmth of the flesh tints, the turn of that head and
neck—divine! I gave a great price for that picture;
but, <i>Cospetto!</i> it was not my own money," and he
laughs feebly. "It will sell for double! That Paolo
Veronese and that Tintoretto yonder came from the
sale of Charles I. of England, after his execution—those
English ruffians! What supple forms, what
classic features!—like my native Romans in the
Imperial city, where the very beggars think themselves
equal to kings; and so they are, <i>per Dio</i>.
Glorious Italy! <i>Ah, cielo!</i>" and he creeps on to a
favourite landscape by Caracci, lit, as it were, by the
living sunshine of the south. "Ah, that sun—I feel
it—wonderful! wonderful!—a gem of the eclectic
school of Bologna, given to me by the Archbishop.
Poor man, he was not, like me, satisfied with art—ha,
ha!"—his laugh ends in a severe fit of coughing.
"He liked nature. He could not stand inquiry.—I
helped him. Oh, my foot!" (And he totters so
helplessly, that the secretary, watching him with
curious eyes, again nearly rushes in; for if Mazarin
dies his salary ceases.) Recovering, however, he
steadies himself against the pedestal of a marble
group just arrived from Rome, "Leda and the Swan."
He drags himself with difficulty into the recess
where it was placed, shifting his position, in order to
catch the precise light in which to view the rounded
limbs of the figure. "What grace, what <i>abandon</i>,
in that female form!—a trifle <i>leste</i> for the gallery of
a prelate—presented, too, by a lady—a woman of
taste, above prejudices. No one has seen it. I must
invite the Court—the Queen-mother will be scandalised.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Ha, ha! the Queen-mother!" and he feebly
winks and laughs; his laugh brings on another fit of
convulsive coughing. (The secretary is on the threshold.)
"I must not die before I have disposed of
my pictures," Mazarin mutters, breathing again; "I
cannot bear to die!—now, too, that I have triumphed
over all my enemies." The Cardinal sighs heavily,
shakes his head, and casts a longing glance round
the painted walls. He tries to move onwards; but
his strength fails him, suddenly his hands are
cramped, the crutch falls on the floor, he groans,
sinks into a chair, and faintly calls for assistance.</p>

<p class="i1">The secretary is with him in an instant, and summons
the attendants. Weary, and utterly exhausted,
they lay him on his bed, where he weeps and groans,
as much from anguish of mind as from bodily pain.
He feels that nothing can amuse or delight him more,
neither singing men nor singing women, the wonders
of art, or the flattery of Courts. From henceforth to
him the world must evermore be mute; the flowers
in the gardens he has created shall no longer fling
their scented blossoms at his feet; to him the birds
are dumb in the groves he has planted, the fruits
cease to be luscious, and the sun is already darkened
by the shadow of death. His face turns of an ashy
hue, and he feebly calls for his physician.</p>

<p class="i1">One of the many attendants that hover about his
bed (each one hoping to be remembered in that will
of his, of which all Paris has heard), flies to fetch
him. He appears in the person of Guénaud, the
Court doctor of that day.</p>

<p class="i1">Mazarin has revived a little. He is propped up
on pillows, to relieve his breathing, which, by reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
of the oppression on his chest, is laboured and difficult.
At the sight of Guénaud he trembles; his teeth
chatter. He has summoned the leech, and now he
dares not hear what he has to say. Mazarin, with his
sensuous Italian temperament, clings wildly to life.
He shrinks from the dark horrors of the grave—he,
who adores sunshine, warmth, open air, and beauty.</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, Guénaud, well. You are in haste to come
to me."</p>

<p class="i1">"Your eminence sent for me," replied the physician
gravely, bowing to the ground; then he contemplates
the Cardinal with that all-seeing eye for
obvious symptoms and for remote details, that
makes the glance of a doctor so awful to the sick.</p>

<p class="i1">"I—I am better, Guénaud—much better, <i>now</i>; I
had fatigued myself among my pictures. But I did
much, Guénaud—I did <i>too</i> much. I even crawled to
my stables—to my garden; I am gaining strength.
To-morrow——"</p>

<p class="i1">Mazarin stops; a severe fit of coughing almost
suffocates him. Again the ashy hue—grey as the
shadows of departing day when the sun has set—overcasts
his features. Guénaud does not reply, but
still contemplates his patient attentively. The Cardinal
looks up; a hectic colour flushes his cheeks.</p>

<p class="i1">"Come," says he, "speak; be honest with me. I
am better?" Guénaud bows.</p>

<p class="i1">"I trust so," replies he.</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Sangue di Dio!</i>"—and the Cardinal grows crimson,
and clenches his thin fingers with nervous agony—"speak.
Your silence agitates me. What have
you to tell me? How long have I to live? Shall I
recover?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Guénaud shakes his head. Mazarin's face again
becomes of a sudden deadly pale. He leans back on
his pillows, and sniffs a strong essence in a filigree
bottle lying by his side. "Guénaud," says he, "I
dread death, but I am no coward. I am prepared
for the worst."</p>

<p class="i1">"I rejoice to hear it," answers the physician
solemnly, feeling his pulse. "You will have need of
all your fortitude."</p>

<p class="i1">"Is it so? Well, then, let me hear my fate!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Your eminence cannot live long. Nothing can
save you."</p>

<p class="i1">A strange look of determination comes into the
Cardinal's eyes as Guénaud speaks. Mazarin was,
as he said, no coward; but the flesh was weaker
than the spirit, and shrank from suffering and disease.
Now that he has heard the truth, he bears it better
than would appear possible in one so slight, nervous,
and attenuated.</p>

<p class="i1">"I cannot flatter your eminence," continues Guénaud,
"your disease is incurable; but I admit that
remedies may prolong your life, though they cannot
preserve it. Remedies, ably administered, can do
much, even in fatal cases."</p>

<p class="i1">"I respect your frankness, doctor," says the Cardinal
calmly. "Speak out, how long can I last?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Your eminence may hope to live for two months,
perhaps, by following the rules I shall prescribe."</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, well—two months! Ah, it is a short time,"—and
a nervous spasm passes over his face, and his
hands twitch with a convulsive spasm. "I do not
die of old age; I have sacrificed my life to France
and to the King. I never got over that negotiation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
at the Pyrenees. Well, well—so be it. At least,
I know my fate. This interval must be consecrated
to the care of my soul. Two months! I shall
do my best. All my brother prelates will assist
me——"</p>

<p class="i1">"To live, your eminence?"</p>

<p class="i1">"No, no, Guénaud,"—and the shadow of a smile
passes over his thin white lips,—"no, no, not to
live, but to die; to die for the sake of the abbeys,
bishoprics, and canonries my death will leave vacant.
In two months one may have a world of indulgences;
that is something. The Holy Father will rejoice at
having my patronage; he is sure to give me a helping
hand; and plenty of indulgences. I stand well
with the Pope, Guénaud. But—but my pictures,
my statues—a collection I have been making all my
life, at such a vast expense. Who knows, Guénaud?
you may be mistaken," he added, brightening up,
his mercurial nature rushing back into its accustomed
channel at the recollection of what had been the
passion of his life. "Who knows, I may get better!"
and his eye turns sharply upon the physician, with
a sparkle of its accustomed fire; "eh, Guénaud—who
knows?" Guénaud bows, but is silent. "You
may be mistaken. <i>Non importa</i>, I must think of my
soul. It is indeed a great trial—a sore trial—a
man of my age, too, with so many years to live!
and such a collection! You know my collection,
Guénaud?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, your eminence," answers he, bowing.</p>

<p class="i1">"The finest in Europe," sighs Mazarin, "and not
yet finished; fresh works coming in daily. A great
trial—but I must think of my soul. Go now, Guénaud;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
come again to-morrow. Perhaps—who knows?—you
may see some change, some improvement—who
knows?"</p>

<p class="i1">Guénaud shakes his head silently, and withdraws.</p>

<p class="i1">Meanwhile the Queen-mother, Anne of Austria,
informed of Mazarin's desperate condition, hastens
to visit him. She is attended by her gossiping
ladies, eager to catch every word, and with nods and
winks, and sighs of affected sympathy—to comment
on her sorrowful expression.</p>

<p class="i1">Her Majesty is pale and sad; tears gather in her
eyes as she advances towards the bed on which
Mazarin lies, and she asks with a timid yet tender
voice after his health. He replies that he is very ill,
and repeats to her what Guénaud had told him. If
I were to add that he displayed to the Queen and
her ladies one of his bare legs, to afford ocular demonstration
of his reduced condition, I fear I should
be accused of imitating the <i>mauvaise langue</i> of
Madame de Noailles. But he really did so, to the
great grief of Anne of Austria, and to the utter discomfiture
and horror of her less sympathising ladies
in waiting, who rapidly retreat into the recesses of
the windows, or behind the draperies of the apartment,
to escape so unpleasant a spectacle.</p>

<p class="i1">"Look!" exclaims Mazarin, thrusting forward his
leg—"look, Madame, at the deplorable condition to
which I am reduced by my incessant anxiety for the
welfare of France! And to leave my pictures too,—my
statues. Ah, Madame, it is a bitter trial!"</p>

<p class="i1">Soon after this extraordinary interview, and when
all the world believed Mazarin to be dead or dying,
the cunning Italian, determined once more to dupe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the whole Court, and deceitful in his death as he had
been in his life, gave orders that his convalescence
should be announced. He caused himself to be
painted white and red, dressed in his Cardinal's purple
robes, and placed in a sedan chair with all the
glasses down. Thus he was wheeled along the broad
terraces of his garden, taking care to be well observed
by the vast crowd collected by the news of
his recovery. For a moment he presented the appearance
of health and vigour. But the effort he had
forced himself to make, in order to enact this ghastly
comedy, was too much for his remaining strength.
He swooned in his sedan chair, and was brought
back and placed on his bed, never to rise again.
Thus died as he had lived, Cardinal Mazarin, a dissembler
and a hypocrite; but a great minister. Not
cruel or bloodthirsty, like Richelieu, though equally
unscrupulous, Mazarin gained the end he had in
view by patience, cunning, and intrigue. At his
death he left France, already exhausted by the wars
of the Fronde, completely subdued; and in such a
state of abject submission to the throne, as paved
the way to the extravagance and oppression of Louis
XIV's reign.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE young King Louis XIV. was active, vigorous,
and graceful. He excelled in outward accomplishments,
in riding, dancing, and fencing; but
intellectually he was both idle and ignorant. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
education had been purposely neglected by Cardinal
Mazarin; and he was so fully aware of it, that he
carefully avoided displaying his ignorance by a too
facile or rapid address. Even in youth he was grave
and ceremonious; in later years he became pompous
and overbearing. On the other hand, the refinement
of his mother's nature was reproduced in the son of
her love. He was brought up by her side in a circle
as elegant and refined as the Hôtel de Rambouillet
in its palmiest days. He never forgot the lesson he
then learnt, that the outward proprieties of life must
be studiously observed, whatever freedoms may be
permitted in private. He desired all his life to be
considered pious, just, and moral. He failed in each,
for his passions were strong and his temper was imperious.
The vicissitudes of his early life during the
civil wars of the Fronde, when he was often obliged
to fly at a moment's notice from place to place, gave
him, however, a power of assuming calmness and
dignity under all circumstances, which he could
never have acquired in less eventful times.</p>

<p class="i1">Above all sovereigns Louis understood the art of
reigning, of appearing to be a great king when he
was really but a shallow, vain, irresolute man, extraordinarily
accessible to flattery. Yet that a son
of Louis XIII. should say with truth, "<i>L'état c'est
moi</i>," and dare to drive out the national Parliament
solemnly assembled in the legislative chamber, <i>whip
in hand</i>, is one of the most striking anomalies in
history.</p>

<p class="i1">In person Louis resembled his father. He was
dark, broad shouldered, and rather short, with regular
features and a prominent nose. But he had all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the fire of his mother's Spanish eyes, and withal
the grandest manners and the most royal presence
ever seen. From a boy he was an ardent admirer of
the fair. All his life he continued to be secretly
ruled by female influence. Indeed, his long reign
may be divided into three periods, corresponding
with the characteristics of the three women who
successively possessed all the love he could spare
from himself. He was gentle, humane, and domestic
with La Vallière; arrogant, heartless, and warlike
with De Montespan; selfish, bigoted, and cruel,
with De Maintenon.</p>

<p class="i1">His boyish philandering with the handsome nieces
of Cardinal Mazarin has been already noticed. What
subtle plans developed themselves in the brain of
that unscrupulous schemer never can be known; but
he could not have arranged matters better to place
one of his nieces on the throne of France. Nor to
his Italian notions would this have been extraordinary.
Mazarin would have argued that a Mancini
was as well born as a Medici, whose arms were a pill,
and that Martinozzi was as ancient a name as Bourbon.</p>

<p class="i1">Anne of Austria looked on with displeasure.
Mazarin wore an imperturbable front, a sphinx-look,
ready to answer either way, as circumstances might
prompt. By the time that Maria Mancini came
from Rome, Louis's passions were thoroughly roused.
The young lion had tasted blood, and found it pleasant
to his palate. Maria was far less beautiful than
her sisters,—indeed, that bitter-tongued chronicler,
Bussy Rabutin, calls her "ugly, fat, and short, with
the air of a <i>soubrette</i>"; but she had the temper of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
an angel, and seemed to the boyish Louis a soft,
plaintive, clinging creature, who appealed to his
pity. In reality she had a force of character ten
times greater than his own, and the courage of a
heroine.</p>

<p class="i1">In Maria Mancini, Mazarin made his great move
in the matrimonial game. Louis gave signs of a
serious attachment. Anne of Austria set a watch
upon him. It was needful. Louis had a temperament
of fire, Maria was born under an Italian sky.
Notwithstanding the watch set Louis found opportunity
to promise marriage to Maria. He repeated
this promise with protestations and oaths, but, cautious
even in his youth, he did not, like his grandfather
Henry IV., commit it to writing.</p>

<p class="i1">Mazarin, informed by his niece of what had passed,
opined that the time to speak had come. He ventured
to sound the Queen-mother. He spoke of
the charms of genuine attachment, the happiness of
domestic life on a throne; he hinted at the Queen's
own unhappy career, sacrificed as she had been to a
political alliance. He enlarged on the antiquity of
the Latin races, specially those of Rome and Sicily,
"all of them," he said, "once reigning houses, and
poverty," he added, "did not make blue blood red."</p>

<p class="i1">The Queen, however subservient to the Cardinal
on all other matters, flared out—"If ever my son
condescends to marry your niece," cried she, "I will
disown him. I will place myself, with his brother,
Philip of Orleans, at the head of the nation, and
fight against him and you, Cardinal Mazarin."</p>

<p class="i1">The Cardinal had many consolations; he was fain
to yield. Maria was sent to a convent. Poor Maria—to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
go to Brouage instead of sitting on a throne!
It was very hard. Louis was in despair. When
they met to say adieu, he wept.</p>

<p class="i1">"What, Sire!" she exclaimed; "you love me—you
weep—and we part?" and she turned her liquid
eyes upon him with a look of passionate entreaty.</p>

<p class="i1">Perhaps the tears in the King's eyes blinded him,
or he did not hear her; at all events, he heeded
neither her look nor her innuendo, and she went.</p>

<p class="i1">Then those marriage bells sounded from over the
frontier of which we have spoken. The King espoused
the Infanta of Spain, and Maria Mancini
became La Principessa Colonna, and lived at Naples.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">The Court is at Saint-Germain. Louis XIV. was
born there, and until Versailles and Marly were
built, he made it his principal residence. In one of
the principal saloons, on the first floor, lying midway
between the turreted angles of the façade, looking
over the plains towards Paris, Louis XIII. had ended
his miserable existence, his private band playing a
"De Profundis," of his own composition, during his
death throes. His morbid nature—reproduced in
his descendant Louis XV., who said he loved "the
scent of newly made graves"—made him await the
approach of death with a sort of grim curiosity. As
he lay on his bed, opposite the windows, his dim
eyes resting on the wide expanse outstretched below,
he called Laporte to him. He was so near his end
that he articulated with difficulty. "Remember,
my good Laporte," he gasped, "that place, below
there, where the road turns under that rise,"—and
he raised his shrunken finger, and pointed to a particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
spot, on the road to Saint-Denis, along which
his funeral procession must pass to reach the tombs
of his ancestors—"that place there. It has been
newly gravelled, Laporte. It is rough, and will
shake me. Let the driver go gently over the loose
stones. Be sure to tell him I said so."</p>

<p class="i1">This was not like his son, Louis XIV., who came
to detest Saint-Germain because this very Cathedral
of Saint-Denis, where he must be buried, was visible
on the horizon line. Such an object did not suit a
monarch who desired to be thought immortal.</p>

<p class="i1">The Court is at Saint-Germain. It is a cool, delicious
evening, after a day of unusual heat. The
summer evenings are always charming at Saint-Germain,
by reason of the bowery freshness of the adjacent
forest, from which cool breezes come rippling
through the air, and fan the heated atmosphere. The
sombre château is now a mass of deep shadow, save
where the setting sun lights up some detail of its
outline—an arched window, a rich cornice, a pillared
portico, or a pointed tower, which stand out against
the western sky with fugitive brightness. The parterre
blazes with summer flowers, the perfume of which
creeps upwards in the rising dews of evening. The
formal gravel walks are bordered by statues and
orange-trees; the splashing of many fountains stirs
the air. A flock of peacocks strut on the greensward,
their long tails catching the last rays of the sunset.
The summer birds make delicate music among the
shrubberies; and the giant elms, in the outer park,
divided from the garden by an open iron railing, bow
their rounded heads to the breeze.</p>

<p class="i1">When the sun has set, a merry party, consisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of four of the maids of honour, leave the château by
a side door. They run swiftly along the terrace,—frightening
the peacocks, who drop their tails and fly
screeching into the trees,—and ensconce themselves
in a trellised arbour, garlanded with honeysuckles and
roses, hid in a thicket of flowering shrubs skirting one
side of the parterre. Once there, their tongues are
let loose like so many cherry-clappers.</p>

<p class="i1">It was so nearly dark that the maids of honour did
not notice the King as they scudded along the garden,
who, attended by the mischief-loving Comte de Lauzun,
had also stolen out to enjoy the evening. Louis
watched them as they ran, and then, hearing their
voices in such eager talk, was seized with an intense
desire to know who they were, and what they were
saying. He dare not speak, for they would hear him,
and perhaps recognise his voice. Signing to his confidant
Lauzun to follow him, he softly approached
the arbour in which the four girls are hid.</p>

<p class="i1">He finds that they are all talking about a fancy
ball given the night before by Madame Henriette,
Duchesse d'Orléans, his brother's wife; and particularly
about a ballet in which he himself had danced.
The King and Lauzun, favoured by the increasing
darkness of the night, and well entrenched behind
the shrubs, lose not a syllable.</p>

<p class="i1">The question is, which dancer was the handsomest
and the most graceful? Each pretty lady has, of
course, her own predilection. One declares for the
Marquis d'Alençon, another will not hear of any comparison
with M. de Vardes, a third stoutly maintains
that the Comte de Guiche was by far the handsomest
man there and everywhere else (an opinion which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
<i>par parenthèse</i>, Madame herself takes every opportunity
of showing she endorses, displaying, moreover,
this opinion somewhat too openly, notwithstanding
her designs on the heart of the King himself, whom
she fancies, and others declare, is, or has been, her
admirer). The fourth damsel is silent. Called upon
to give her opinion, she speaks. In the sweetest and
gentlest of voices she thus expresses herself:—</p>

<p class="i1">"I cannot imagine how any one could have been
even noticed when the King was present. He is quite
fascinating."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, then, mademoiselle, you declare for the King.
What will Madame say to you?"</p>

<p class="i1">"No, it is not the King nor the crown he wears
that I declare for; it is not his rank that makes him
so charming: on the contrary, to me it is rather a
defect. If he were not the King I should positively
dread him. His position is my best safeguard.
However——" And La Vallière drops her head on
her bosom and falls into a deep reverie.</p>

<p class="i1">On hearing these words the King is strangely
affected, he whispers to Lauzun not to mention their
adventure; they retire silently as they came, and re-enter
the château. The King is in a dilemma. If
he could only discover who this fair damsel is who
prefers him to all others with such naïveté—who
admires him for himself alone, and not for his rank—a
preference as flattering as it is rarely the lot of a
monarch to discover! All he knows is that it must
be one of the maids of honour attached to the
service of Madame Henriette, his sister-in-law, and
he cannot sleep all night, he is so haunted with the
melting tones of her voice, and so anxious to discover
to whom it belongs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">In the morning, as soon as etiquette allowed of
his appearing, Louis hurries off to the toilette of
Madame, whom he finds seated before a mirror of
the rarest Dresden china, looped up with lace and
ribbons, her face and shoulders covered with her
long brown hair.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Majesty honours me with an early visit,"
says she, colouring with pleasure as he enters.
"What plans have you arranged for the hunt to-day?
When are we to start?"</p>

<p class="i1">Louis, with his usual politeness—shown, be it
recorded to his credit, towards any woman, whatever
might be her degree—gallantly replies that it is for
her to command and for him to obey. But there the
conversation drops, and the Duchess observes that he
is absent and preoccupied. This both chagrines
and disappoints her. Piqued at his want of <i>empressement</i>,
she turns from him abruptly and begins
conversing with the Comte de Guiche, who with ill-disguised
uneasiness had stood aloof watching her
warm reception of his Majesty.</p>

<p class="i1">Henriette, the royal daughter of the Stuarts and
the Bourbons, without being positively handsome,
has the air of a great princess. The freshness of her
complexion is, however, all that is English about
her. Her forehead, high and broad, but too much
developed for beauty, gives a certain grandeur to her
expression; her eyes are sparkling, but placed too
near together. Still her face is intelligent and lively.
She is tall, slim, and very graceful. Around her
long neck, on which her small head is admirably set,
is bound a single string of fine orient pearls, and a
mantle and train of turquoise <i>faille</i> fall back from
a flounced petticoat of yellow satin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">While Madame Henriette talks with the Comte
de Guiche, Louis is at liberty to use his eyes as he
chooses, and he hastily surveys the group of lovely
girls that stand behind the Princess's chair. One
placed a little apart from the rest rivets his attention.
Her pale and somewhat melancholy countenance
imparts an indescribable air of languor to her appearance,
and the graceful <i>tournure</i> of her head and
neck are admirable.</p>

<p class="i1">"Can this be she?" he asks himself. He hopes—he
fears (he was young then, Louis, and not the
<i>blasé débauché</i> he afterwards became)—he actually
trembles with emotion, suspense, and impatience.
But determined to ascertain the truth, and regardless
of the furious glances cast at him by Madame,—who
evidently neither likes nor understands his wandering
looks, directed evidently to her ladies, and his total
want of <i>empressement</i> towards herself,—he approaches
the fair group and begins conversing with them,
certain that if that same soft voice is heard that had
never ceased to echo in his ears, he shall at once
recognise it. He speaks to Mademoiselle de Saint-Aignan,
but his eyes are fixed on the pale face of La
Vallière, for she it was whom he so much admired.
La Vallière casts down her eyes and blushes.</p>

<p class="i1">The King advances towards her and addresses her.
He awaits her reply with indescribable anxiety. She
trembles, grows still more pale, then blushes crimson,
and finally answers in a voice tremulous with timidity;
but it was <i>the</i> voice! He has found her. This,
then, is the unknown, and she loves him; her own
lips confessed it. Delightful! He leaves the apartments
of Madame abruptly in speechless ecstasy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">From that day he sees, he lives only for La Vallière.
Ever in the apartments of his sister-in-law, it
was evident even to her that he did not come to
seek her, and her rage knew no bounds. She had
hitherto had ample reason to believe that the attachment
the King felt for her somewhat exceeded that
of a brother. With the spiteful penetration of a
jealous woman, she now discovers how often the eyes
of Louis are fixed with admiration on the timid,
downcast La Vallière. She is not, therefore, long
in guessing the object of his preference, and the
cause of his frequent visits to her apartments. From
this moment she hates poor Louise, and determines,
if possible, to ruin her.</p>

<p class="i1">The King on his part, unconscious of the storm
he was raising about La Vallière, is enchanted not
only with herself, but with all he hears of her character.
She is beloved by every one; her goodness,
sweetness, and sincerity are universally acknowledged,
and the account of her various good qualities
tend to enhance her merit.</p>

<p class="i1">When the Court returns to Saint-Germain (now,
can one fancy romance within those dingy walls?—but
so it was), Louis is desperately, head and ears
over, in love. A party of pleasure is arranged to
take place in the forest under a tent formed of
boughs, tapestry, and flowers. The ladies invited
to this sylvan retreat are habited as shepherdesses
and peasants. They form charming groups, like
Sèvres china. On their arrival the most delicious
music is heard from the recesses of the leafy woods,
which as it plays at intervals, now here, now there,
among the trees, is the signal for the appearance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
various groups of satyrs, fauns, and dryads, who
after dancing grotesque figure-dances, and singing
verses in honour of the King, disappear, to be
quickly replaced by another <i>troupe</i>. These present
flowers, and also sing and dance as no dryads or
fauns had ever dreamed of in classic bowers, but in
a style quite peculiar to the age and taste of <i>le Grand
Monarque</i>, who liked even nature itself to appear as
artificial and formal as he was himself. This agreeable
fête has lasted all day, and the company is about
to return, when, conceive the alarm—a violent storm
comes on, thunder rolls, the sky is suddenly overcast,
and a heavy rain, enough to drench the whole
Court to the skin, descends with remorseless violence.
How every one scuds hither and thither! The
thickest trees are eagerly seized on as a slight protection
against the storm. Others hide themselves
in the bushes, some penetrate deeper into the cover
of the copse wood. Spite of the rain, and the destruction
of the dresses, the ladies come to vote it
rather an agreeable incident on the whole, when they
find their favourite cavaliers beside them, placed,
perchance, somewhat nearer than would have been
<i>comme il faut</i> in the Court circle. For although the
ladies might really at first have been a little terrified,
the gentlemen are certainly not likely to be troubled
with any nervousness on account of a thunderstorm,
and preserve sufficient <i>sang-froid</i> each to select his
lady-love in order to protect her from the weather.
Thus it chanced that Madame Henriette finds herself
under the care of the Comte de Guiche; the fair
Mancini, once beloved by the King, now Comtesse
de Soissons, is under the protection of her dear De
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Vardes; and Mademoiselle d'Orléans—<i>la Grande
Mademoiselle</i>—is completely happy, and forgets the
thunder, rain, and, more wonderful still, her own dignity,
at finding herself escorted by Lauzun!</p>

<p class="i1">The King, nowise behind his courtiers in gallantry,
at once offers his escort and his arm to support La
Vallière, who, naturally timid, is really frightened,
and clings to him with a helplessness that enchants
him. All the world knows she is a little lame, a defect
which was said in her to be almost a grace. Now
she does not perhaps regret that this infirmity prevents
her running as quickly as the rest, and thus
prolonging the precious moments passed alone with
the King. Louis places her under a tree, where
they are both protected from the rain and are
shrouded by the thick boughs which hang low and
fringe the grass.</p>

<p class="i1">The King seizes on this happy opportunity to
declare his passion, and to whisper to La Vallière the
love she has inspired ever since that evening, when
he had overheard her. Poor Louise! She had never
dared to imagine that her love was returned, and she
well-nigh faints as the King proceeds. Her heart
beats so violently it is almost audible. She is
actually on the point of rushing from under the
tree, when the King lays hold of her hand, and
retains her.</p>

<p class="i1">"What!" cries he, "do you fear me more than the
storm? What have I done to frighten you? you
whom I love, whom I adore! Why do you hate me?
Speak, I implore you, Louise."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Sire! do not say hate. I revere you—I love
you—as my King, but——"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Sweet girl, I breathe again. But why only love
me as your Sovereign—I, who cherish your every
look, who seek only to be your servant—your
slave?"</p>

<p class="i1">Saying this, Louis falls on his knees upon the
grass; he seizes her hands, which he covers with
kisses; he swears he will never rise until she has
promised to love him, and to pardon the terror his
declaration has caused her.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle de la Vallière cannot control her
emotion. She implores him to rise.</p>

<p class="i1">"You are my King," she says, "the husband of
the Queen. My royal master, I am your faithful
subject. Can I say more?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, dearest, promise me your love. Give me
your heart; that is the possession I desire," murmurs
Louis.</p>

<p class="i1">Pressed by the King to grant him some mark of
her favour, La Vallière becomes so confused she
cannot reply. Louis grows more and more pressing,
interpreting her emotion as favourable to his suit.
In the midst of the tenderest entreaties the thunder
again bursts forth, and poor Louise, overcome at once
by fear, love, and remorse, swoons away. The King
naturally receives the precious burden in his arms.
He seeks hastily to rejoin the other fugitives and his
attendants, in order to obtain assistance. Ever and
anon he stops in the openings of the forest to gaze
at her, as she lies calm and lovely in repose, her long
eye-lashes sweeping her delicate cheeks, her half-closed
lips revealing the prettiest and whitest teeth.
I leave my readers to imagine if Louis did not imprint
a few kisses on the fainting beauty he bears so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
carefully in his arms, and if now and then he did not
press her closer to his breast. If in this he <i>did</i> take
advantage of the situation chance had afforded him,
he must be forgiven; he was young, and he was
deeply in love.</p>

<p class="i1">Words cannot describe the surprise felt by La
Vallière on recovering to find herself alone, borne
along in the King's arms, in the midst of a lonely
forest. History does not, however, record that she
died of terror, or that she even screamed. The
respectful behaviour of the King doubtless reassured
her.</p>

<p class="i1">The moment she opens her sweet blue eyes he
stops, places her on the ground, and supports her.
He assures her that being then near the edge of the
forest, and not far distant from the château, they
are sure to meet some of his attendants. Louise
blushes, then grows pale, then blushes again, as the
recollection of all the King had said to her while
under the shade of the greenwood gradually returns
to her remembrance. She reads the confirmation of
it in his eyes. Those eyes are fixed on her with
passionate ardour. Disengaging herself from his
arms, she thanks him, in a faltering voice, for his
care a thousand times—for his condescension. She
is so sorry. It was so foolish to faint; but the
thunder—his Majesty's goodness to her—— Here
she pauses abruptly; her conscience tells her she
ought at once to reject his suit; her lips cannot form
the words.</p>

<p class="i1">While she is speaking, a group of horsemen are
visible in the distance, at the end of one of those
long woodland glades which divide the forest. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
hearing the voice of the King, who calls to them,
they gallop rapidly towards him. The King and La
Vallière reach the château shortly after the other
ladies, none of whom, as it appeared, had been in
haste to return.</p>

<p class="i1">From this moment La Vallière's fate is sealed.
Long she had loved and admired the King in secret;
but until she learnt how warmly he returned this
feeling she was scarcely aware how completely he
had enthralled her. The ecstasy this certainty gave
her first fully revealed to her the real danger of her
situation. Poor Louise! Is it wonderful that, as
the scene of this first and passionate declaration,
she should love the old Château of Saint-Germain
more than any other spot in the world?—that when
suffering, the air restored her? when unhappy (and
she lived to be so unhappy), the sight of the forest,
of the terrace, revived her by tender reminiscences
of the past?</p>

<p class="i1">When the secret of Louis's attachment to La Vallière
transpired (which, after the scene in the forest
was very speedily), nothing could exceed the indignation
of the whole circle, who each conceived that
they had some especial cause of complaint.</p>

<p class="i1">Louis's old love, the Comtesse de Soissons (Mancini),
with the thirst for practical revenge bred in
her hot Italian blood, held council with De Vardes
and De Guiche, how to crush her, whom she styled
"the common enemy." A letter was planned and
written by the Countess in Spanish, addressed to
the Queen, purporting to come from the King of
Spain. This letter detailed every particular of her
husband's <i>liaison</i> with La Vallière. The bad spelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and foreign idioms, however, betrayed it to be a
forgery.</p>

<p class="i1">The letter was placed on the Queen's bed by the
Comtesse de Soissons herself. Instead of falling into
the Queen's hands, as was intended, it was found by
De Molena, Maria Theresa's Spanish nurse. She
carried it straight to the King. He traced it to
Madame de Soissons. She was banished.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame Henriette d'Orléans was more noisy and
abusive than any one. Her vanity was hurt. Her
feelings were outraged at the notion that the King,
heretofore her admirer, should forsake her openly
for one of her own women! It was too insulting.</p>

<p class="i1">"What!" cried she in her rage, "prefer an ugly,
limping <i>fillette</i> to <i>me</i>, the daughter of a king? I am
as superior in beauty to that little minx as I am in
birth! <i>Dieu! qu'il manque de goût et de délicatesse!</i>"
Without even taking leave of Louis she shut herself
up at Saint-Cloud, where she made the very walls
ring with her complaints.</p>

<p class="i1">The poor, quiet little Queen, the only really injured
person, wept and mourned in private. She
was far too much afraid of that living Jupiter
Tonans, her husband, to venture on any personal
reproaches. She consoled herself by soundly abusing
La Vallière in epithets much more expressive
than polite.</p>

<p class="i1">In this abuse she was joined by Anne of Austria,
who, in her present austere frame of mind, was the
last person in France to spare La Vallière.</p>

<p class="i1">An explanation was decidedly needful.</p>

<p class="ac">THE CONVENT OF CHAILLOT.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-m.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap M" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIÈRE is
summoned to the presence of the Queen-mother.
She is sitting in the Grey Chamber, next
to her oratory. Louise is aware that Anne of Austria
never gives audiences in the Grey Chamber
except on the most serious occasions. The Queen-mother
wears a dark dress, in cut and shape like the
robe of a nun; her grey hair is gathered into a head-dress
of white lace, and she carries a rosary at her
side. She looks old and sad; her stately form is
bent, her face is thin, her features are drawn, and
wrinkles obscure her once brilliant eyes.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse d'Orléans is seated by her side.
Louise enters. She dares not advance beyond the
door. Standing there she makes deep obeisances to
the Queen-mother and to Madame Henriette. She
blushes scarlet, then turns pale. Her head drops
on her bosom; as she stands before them she feels
more dead than alive.</p>

<p class="i1">"I see you are there, Mademoiselle de la Vallière,"
says the Queen, frowning. "I wish to speak
to you in the presence of your late mistress, Madame
Henriette de France, my daughter-in-law. You are
aware why we have sent for you?"</p>

<p class="i1">"No, Madame," answers the maid of honour,
faintly, "but I humbly await your orders."</p>

<p class="i1">"What affected humility!" exclaims Madame
Henriette with a sneer. "You act uncommonly
well, <i>petite</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"All the better if she be humble, my daughter,"
rejoins the Queen-mother, speaking of La Vallière
as if she were not present—"all the better. It is
some step towards repentance that she is conscious
of her crime. It will save us the trouble of insisting
on it. Pray to God, mademoiselle, to pardon you;
you have no hope but in heaven." And she casts a
stern glance at her.</p>

<p class="i1">The tears gather in La Vallière's soft blue eyes.
They course each other down her pallid cheeks, and
fall, spotting her pale blue dress. Her head, covered
with a profusion of short fair curls, is still bent
down. She looks like a delicate flower bowed before
a cruel tempest.</p>

<p class="i1">"What are you going to do with those fine diamond
bracelets the King presented to you the other
day out of the Queen's lottery?" asks Madame
Henriette tauntingly, interrupting the Queen.</p>

<p class="i1">Anne of Austria makes a sign to her to be silent.
Poor Louise for an instant turns her eyes imploringly
upon her. Madame grows pale with spite as
she remembers those superb diamond bracelets that
the King drew as a prize from the lottery,—which
she had fully expected he would present to herself,—were
given by him to La Vallière. She is so
wroth she cannot leave Louise alone; again she
attacks her. "Your vanity is insufferable, mademoiselle.
Do you imagine, <i>petite sotte</i>, that any one
cares for <i>you</i>? Mademoiselle de Pons is the belle
of the Court. His Majesty says so."</p>

<p class="i1">At this malicious stab Louise shudders.</p>

<p class="i1">"My daughter," interposes the Queen-mother,
"do not agitate yourself. I understand your annoyance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
at having introduced such a person as
Mademoiselle de la Vallière at Court. Let <i>me</i>
address her. She is unworthy of your notice. You
understand, of course, mademoiselle, that you are
dismissed," she says, turning towards her and speaking
imperiously.</p>

<p class="i1">"But, your Majesty—" and La Vallière's streaming
eyes are again lifted upwards for an instant—"what,
oh, what have I done?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Ask yourself, mademoiselle. Unless there are
to be two queens of France, you must go. You
cannot wish me, the mother of his Majesty, to
enter into details on a subject so painful to my
feelings."</p>

<p class="i1">"No, I should think not," breaks in Madame
Henriette, "unless you have no sense of decency.
A little unworthy chit like you to dare to trouble
royal princesses; you are as impertinent as you are
disreputable."</p>

  <div class="caption">MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIÈRE.<br />
    <span class="smaller">FROM A STEEL ENGRAVING.</span></div>
</div>

<p class="i1">At these cruel words La Vallière staggers backwards,
and almost falls. Then she again turns her
swollen eyes towards the royal ladies with absolute
terror.</p>

<p class="i1">Ah, heaven! she thinks, if the King did but know
her agony, her sufferings! Ah, if he were but here
to speak for her! But not a word passes her lips.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame Henriette's eyes fix themselves on her
with a look of triumph. She becomes absolutely
radiant at the sight of the humiliation of her whom
she calls "her rival."</p>

<p class="i1">"You know our pleasure, mademoiselle," says
Anne of Austria, rising from her arm-chair." You
will return from whence you came—Touraine, I believe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
You will be conducted by Madame de Choisy;
but, indeed, you need no escort; you have nothing
to fear <i>now</i>," and the Queen-mother casts a look of
withering contempt on the wretched girl, more offensive
even than her bitter words.</p>

<p class="i1">Louise shrinks backwards. She would fain escape.</p>

<p class="i1">"Do not forget, mademoiselle, before you go,
to thank Madame Henriette de France for all her
goodness to you," says the Queen, arresting her
with a motion—"goodness, indeed, you have so
ill requited."</p>

<p class="i1">"No, no!" cries Madame; "I want no thanks. I
only want to be rid of her. Let her go, my mother;
I ask no more."</p>

<p class="i1">The two Princesses rise together. They both deliberately
turn their backs upon La Vallière, and
leave the room. For some moments she stands as if
turned into stone. Then she gives a wild scream,
raises her small hands, clutches the delicate curls that
hang about her face, and rushes from "the Grey
Chamber."</p>

<p class="i1">"Dishonoured—banished! Ah, God! what will
become of me?" she cries distractedly when she has
locked herself in her own room. "Ah! what will my
mother say when she knows all? Holy Virgin, I am
lost!"</p>

<p class="i1">She paces up and down the floor—she sobs, she
moans. Everything about her reminds her of the
King. She handles the presents he has given her;
she takes out his letters; she kisses them; she presses
them to her bosom. She tries to collect her thoughts,
but the murmur of the night wind, sweeping over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the trees in the adjacent forest and whistling
round the angles of the palace, catches her ear. To
her excited imagination it wails lamentations over
her. As she listens she seems to hear her mother's
voice reproaching her. Now as the blast rises higher
and higher it is her father, who curses her in the
tempest that sweeps by. Trembling in every limb
she rises and dashes the glittering baubles she still
holds in her hands to the ground. Her head reels,
her reason totters. Fresh sobs and fresh torrents of
tears come to her relief. Suddenly the same idea, in
the same place, rushes into her mind as had struck
Louise de Lafayette, yet under widely different circumstances.
Louise de Lafayette, a creature so pure,
so angelic as to start back dismayed from the faintest
whisper of a too ardent love—she, Louise de la Vallière,
held up to public contumely, dismissed the
Court! She must fly; she must never be heard of
more. She can never return home. A convent must
hide her. "God alone and the blessed saints are
left to me!" she cries; "wretch that I am, let me
seek them where they may be found."</p>

<p class="i1">As soon as the grey morning comes creeping into
her room, lighting up her white face and crushed
figure, as she leans back in the chair where she has
sat immovable all the live-long night, she rises, and
puts together a little bundle of necessaries. She
covers herself with a cloak, and softly opening the
door, makes her way down the nearest flight of stairs.
No one sees her, for the day is only dawning. She
glides swiftly out of the palace, passes the gate,
where the sentinel is sleeping at his post, and finds
herself in the street of the little town of Saint-Germain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Her heart beats so quickly, and her steps are
so rapid, that she is soon obliged to stop for want of
breath. Not knowing where to go, she leans against
the corner of a house. She strains her eyes up and
down the street in every direction, but sees no one of
whom she can ask her way. At last, at the bottom
of the <i>grande rue</i>, a country woman appears, carrying
a basket on her arm. She is on her way to market.
Louise flies towards her. The woman stares at her.
La Vallière's lips move, but she has no breath to speak.</p>

<p class="i1">"God speed you, pretty lady. Where are you
going so early?" asks the peasant.</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Ma bonne</i>," at last answers La Vallière, when she
has recovered her breath, "can you tell me the way
to Chaillot? I want to go to the convent."</p>

<p class="i1">Now, Chaillot was a convent founded by Henrietta
Maria, Queen of England, situated between
Saint-Germain and Paris, no vestige of which now
remains.</p>

<p class="i1">"Surely, <i>belle dame</i>, I can tell you. Come with me,
I am going that way," and the woman stares at her
again. "Why are you out so early? Are you from
the palace?"</p>

<p class="i1">"No, no!" gasps La Vallière, terrified to death
lest the woman's suspicions should be aroused, and
that she would refuse to let her follow her. "I am
not from the palace. Ask me nothing. I can only
tell you that a great misfortune has happened to
me, and that I am going to consult the Superior of
Sainte-Marie, at Chaillot, who is my friend."</p>

<p class="i1">The peasant asks no more questions, and La Vallière,
who clings to her side, arrives in due time under
the walls of Chaillot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"There, mademoiselle, is the Church of the Sisters
of Sainte-Marie. God speed you."</p>

<p class="i1">Louise rings the bell, and asks the portress to be
permitted to speak with the Superior.</p>

<p class="i1">"She is in retreat, madame, and cannot be disturbed,"
the portress replies.</p>

<p class="i1">"In the name of God, my sister, tell her that a
person in great affliction craves her help."</p>

<p class="i1">The portress does not immediately answer, but
leads her into a hall within, at one end of which is
the latticed <i>grille</i> which divides the professed nuns
from the lay sisters.</p>

<p class="i1">An hour passes, and no one appears. La Vallière,
fatigued by the unaccustomed exercise, almost distracted,
gazes wistfully at the bare walls that surround
her. This then is to be the living tomb of her youth,
her love. This grim refuge or the grave. She turns
to the strong door, bound with iron bars, by which
she entered, and shudders. She watches the handle;
no one comes, not a sound breaks the silence. It
seems to her that God and man have alike forsaken
her—a creature so vile, so unworthy. Her
repentance has come too late. Heaven's mercy-gates
are closed! A wild, unreasoning terror seizes her—her
brain beats as with iron hammers—she grows cold
and faint—a mist gathers before her eyes—a deadly
sickness creeps over her—she falls senseless on the
stone floor.</p>

<p class="i1">When she opens her eyes, she is lying upon a clean
bed, shaded by snowy curtains, in a little white-washed
cell; two dark-robed Carmelite sisters are
bending over her.</p>

<p class="i1">It was not long before the King heard that La
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Vallière had fled. Not daring to make too public
inquiries, he sent for the superintendent of police,
La Regnie.</p>

<p class="i1">"Find Mademoiselle de la Vallière," he says,
"dead or alive; find her instantly—instantly, I
say, or I dismiss you from my service."</p>

<p class="i1">This was not difficult; the trembling steps of the
fugitive were soon traced. La Regnie returns, and
informs his royal master that La Vallière is within
the Convent of Chaillot. Louis does not lose a
moment in following her. He appears at the convent
gate, accompanied by his confidant, Lauzun.
He demands admittance. Some of the older nuns,
scandalised at the idea of a man entering the cloister,
refuse to unlock the gate; but the Mother-Superior,
wiser in her generation, herself descends, and key in
hand undoes the fastenings, and welcomes his Majesty
with the utmost deference.</p>

<p class="i1">Meanwhile, La Vallière, somewhat recovered from
her swoon, sits alone beside a narrow window which
overlooks the convent garden. She feels dull and
oppressed; her eyes are dazed; her head is heavy.</p>

<p class="i1">The perfect silence around her, the homely little
cell looking into a peaceful garden, full of herbs and
vegetables for the service of the convent, in one
corner a grove of cypress-trees, which overtops the
high walls that encircle it, is all new and strange to
her. She seems to have passed into another world.
She remembers but indistinctly all that has happened;
she has almost forgotten how she came
there. A pensive melancholy paralyses her senses.
She is very weak and helpless; her brain is still
confused. It is all very strange. She cannot collect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
her thoughts, but over all the mists of memory,
plain and distinct, rise a face and form dear to her
beyond life.</p>

<p class="i1">Suddenly a sound of approaching footsteps awakens
the echoes of the long corridor leading to the cell.
As well as steps there is a confused hum of many
persons talking. At first she listens vaguely; then,
as the sounds grow nearer, she springs to her feet.
A sound has struck upon her ear—a sound sweeter
than music. It is the King's voice! The door is flung
open, and Louis—his handsome face flushed with
excitement, his eyes beaming with tenderness—stands
before her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Come," he says softly, whispering into her ear,
and pressing her cold hand within both his own,
"come, my beloved, you have nothing in common
with this dreary place. I am here to carry you away.
Fear no one; I will protect you—I will glory in protecting
you. Rise, my Louise, and follow me."</p>

<p class="i1">The Carmelite sisters stand peeping in at the door.
The Superior alone has followed his Majesty into the
cell. Some moments pass before Louise commands
her voice to speak; at last, in a scarcely audible
whisper, and trembling all over, she says—</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire,——" then, not daring to meet the King's
impassioned glance, she pauses; "Sire," she repeats,
"I did not come here of my own accord. I was
obliged to leave. My remaining at Saint-Germain
offended her Majesty and other great personages—"
she stops again, overcome by the recollection of the
scene with the Queen and the Duchesse d'Orléans—"personages,
Sire, whom I dare not—I <i>could</i> not
offend." Her soft face is suffused with a blush of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
anguish; she hangs down her head. "I was sent
away, Sire; it was not my wish to go—indeed it was
not my wish!" she adds, in a voice so low and
tremulous that Louis could not have heard what she
said had he not bent down his ear close to her white
lips.</p>

<p class="i1">"Then you shall return, dearest, for mine. I am
master, and my wish is law. I care nothing for
'august personages'; they shall learn to obey me—the
sooner the better."</p>

<p class="i1">"But, Sire, I cannot be the cause of strife. The
Queen-mother and Madame have dismissed me; and
they were right," she added in a very faint voice. "I
dare not offend them by my presence, after——" She
stops, and can say no more.</p>

<p class="i1">"Think of the future, Louise, not of the past; it is
gone," and Louis takes her trembling hands in his.
"A future lies before you full of joy. Leave the
Queen-mother to me, Louise. Come—come with
me," and with gentle violence he tries to raise her
from her chair. "Follow me, and fear nothing."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Sire," whispers Louise, the colour again
leaving her cheeks, "do not tempt me from my
vocation."</p>

<p class="i1">"Do not talk to me of your vocation," returns
Louis roughly; "what is your vocation to me?
Can you part from me so lightly?" he adds, more
gently.</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas, Sire, I dare not return to Court; every look
would condemn me!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Condemn you! Believe me, I will place you so
high that no one shall dare to condemn you. Am I
not the master?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, suffer me to lay my sins upon the altar! Do
not seek to prevent it," sighs La Vallière, clasping
her hands. "But remember, Sire, oh, remember,
that in my heart you can have no rival but heaven."
She speaks with passion, but she dares not look
up at him; had she done so, she would have
quailed before the expression of his eyes;—they
devour her.</p>

<p class="i1">All this is said very low, in order not to be overheard
by the Superior, who, although she has retired
as far as the doorway, is still present.</p>

<p class="i1">"Louise, you do not love me. You have never
loved me," whispers Louis, and he turns away. He
is deeply offended; her resistance to his commands
enrages him.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, heaven!" La Vallière sighs, and turns her
blue eyes, swimming with tears, towards him, "would
to God it were so!" She speaks in so subdued a
tone—she is so crushed, so fragile—that the King's
compassion is suddenly excited; he looks steadfastly
into her face; he trembles lest she may die under
this trial. Again he takes her hand, raises her from
her chair, and draws her towards the door.</p>

<p class="i1">"If you love me, Louise, follow me. I cannot
live without you!" he adds almost fiercely. "Fear
nothing. Her Majesty shall receive you. The
Queen-mother and Madame"—at their names La
Vallière quivers all over—"shall offend you no more.
Leave this horrible cell, my Louise. Come, and let
me enshrine you in a temple worthy of your beauty,
your goodness, and of my love," he adds, in a fervid
whisper, which makes her heart throb with rapture.

<p class="drop-cap">NICHOLAS FOUQUET, Marquis de Belle-Isle
and Vicomte de Mélun et Vaux,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> held the
post of Superintendent of Finance under the Regency
of Anne of Austria. He was continued in this important
office after the accession of Louis XIV.
Fouquet was insinuating, specious, hypocritical, and
sensual; a munificent patron to those about him, and
an adorer of the beautiful in art and nature. He
was, moreover, one of those courtly financiers so
constantly met with before the Revolution, who, however
the country starved, always found funds "for
the service of his Majesty."</p>

<a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Vaux-Praslin, near Mélun, is still a superb château. It was sold
by the son of the Superintendent to the Maréchal de Villars who, in
his turn, sold it to the Duc de Praslin.</p></div>

<p class="i1">In course of time, Louis grew alarmed at Fouquet's
reckless expenditure; his personal magnificence
was boundless, but there was not a <i>sous</i> of
state money in reserve. Colbert was consulted by
the King. Colbert was jealous of Fouquet's position;
he examined his accounts, and found them incorrect.
The King courteously pointed out the errors
to Fouquet, who persisted in the perfect accuracy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
his figures. Louis, convinced of the Superintendent's
dishonesty, resolved to dismiss him on the first
opportunity.</p>

  <img src="images/i-168.jpg"

  <div class="caption">FOUQUET.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">But this falsification of accounts was his least
cause of offence to his Sovereign. Fouquet had presumed
to imitate the Olympian tastes of the <i>Grand
Monarque</i>. If Louis was a god, his Superintendent
was at least a demi-god, and claimed a demi-god's
privilege of "loving the daughters of men." Unfortunately,
too, he dared to raise his eyes to those particular
idols worshipped by the King. His disgrace
was therefore certain. Some indistinct rumours of
the danger that threatened him reached his ears. He
was moved, but not alarmed. He racked his fertile
brain how best to recover favour, and he determined
to give so magnificent a fête in honour of the King
at his country-seat, Vaux, near Mélun, as should remove
all suspicion of his loyalty. Such were the
customs of the age. Having for years systematically
robbed the State, Fouquet was to reinstate himself
in favour by a still more public theft!</p>

<p class="i1">Before Versailles arose on the sand-hills lying between
Saint-Cyr and the wooded uplands of Saint-Cloud,
Vaux was the most splendid palace in France.
The architect was Le Vau, celebrated by Boileau.
The <i>corps de logis</i> was surmounted by a dome supported
by sixteen marble arches, resting on pillars;
two immense pavilions formed the wings. The gardens,
designed by Le Nôtre, were decorated with
statues, and ballustraded terraces bordering canals,
and water-works, in the Italian fashion—"surprises,"
as they were called. All was formal and symmetrical;
the very plants and shrubs were only permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
to grow to order. Nature was banished to the distant
woods, which spread in verdant folds about the
rising ground behind the château, and decked the
greensward of the park, ere it reached the waters of
the Seine flowing below.</p>

<p class="i1">The fête was fixed for the 17th of August. It was
a splendid day; the sky was unclouded, and the
golden sunshine lighted up the deepest recesses of
the forest, when Louis started in the morning from
Fontainebleau, where the Court was then staying.
He was escorted by D'Artagnan and a regiment of
musketeers.</p>

<p class="i1">There was a goodly company; the King drove La
Vallière and the Comtesse de Guiche in his <i>calèche</i>;
the Queen-mother came in her coach; other ladies
were in litters. The Queen, who was in an interesting
state of health, stayed at home. Fouquet stood
ready, at the grand entrance of his palace. He received
the King kneeling, and presented to him the
golden keys of Vaux. Louis touched them with his
fingers, raised Fouquet from the ground, and in a few
gracious words assured him of his favour and protection;
with what truth we shall see. The same ceremony
was repeated by Madame Fouquet to the
Queen mother, with a like result.</p>

<p class="i1">On entering the vestibule, even the Gallic Jupiter
was amazed at the magnificence of all he saw. The
suite of rooms were arranged in allegorical order, each
named after a god or goddess; the ceilings and walls
painted to represent their attributes and the events
of their lives. The sun and moon, the planets and
fixed stars, also formed an important feature in the
decorations. The seasons added their attributes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
together with the winds lent themselves gracefully to
the necessities of the general arrangements. His
Majesty was invited to repose in the billiard-room,
dedicated to Hercules, who by a happy invention
prefigured himself. From the billiard-room he entered
the grand saloon, where the sun, in gorgeous
colours of saffron, crimson, and scarlet, covered the
entire ceiling. Louis smiled a smile of gratification;
the sun was his acknowledged emblem. Was it possible,
he thought, that Fouquet might be forgiven?
The Superintendent advanced. He bowed to the
ground, and asked leave to explain the legend.</p>

<p class="i1">"The sun—the centre of the universe, the creator
of light, heat, and life—is your Majesty. Deprived
of your gracious presence, we sink into darkness
and death. That star beside the sun is myself,
Sire, receiving light from your Majesty's benignant
rays."</p>

<p class="i1">Louis frowned, and bit his lip. It seemed to him
that the star was dangerously near the sun; it
displeased him. He changed his mind, and now
decided that that too assertative star must be
extinguished.</p>

<p class="i1">From the saloon, Louis passed into a retiring-room,
dedicated to the Muses and the Virtues, all
with open mouths, grouped round a figure of Fidelity,
whose praises they sang.</p>

<p class="i1">"Who is represented by fidelity?" asked Louis,
turning to the Duc de Saint-Aignan, in attendance
on him.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have just been told that Fidelity represents
Fouquet himself, your Majesty."</p>

<p class="i1">"What on earth can Fidelity have to do with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Superintendent of Finance?" muttered Louis, shrugging
his shoulders. "And that female figure conducting
Fidelity—who is that?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Prudence, I am told," replied Saint-Aignan.
"Prudence; and the one on the other side is Reason."</p>

<p class="i1">"Prudence, Reason, and Fidelity guiding Fouquet.
<i>Ma foi</i>, it is not bad," and an ironical smile
passed over the monarch's face. "But we have
not done with the paintings yet. Who are the
others?"</p>

<p class="i1">"That figure, Sire, in a golden-coloured robe, is
Clio, I am told, the Muse of History. With one
hand she assists Fidelity into heaven, with the other
she records the annals of his life."</p>

<p class="i1">"The annals of <i>his</i> life," muttered the King (for
Fouquet stood near at hand, to be summoned by his
Sovereign when wanted). "It will be well for him
if history does not record his signal disgrace. He
may prove another Phaeton, this M. Fouquet, and
fall from the stars into eternal darkness. Jupiter
still grasps his thunders. Let us leave this room—it
stifles me," said Louis aloud. "What is the
meaning of the device of the serpents I see everywhere?"
again inquired Louis of the Duke.</p>

<p class="i1">"The serpents represent Colbert, the rival of
Fouquet, Sire. Fidelity, Reason, and Discretion
crush these serpents as you see."</p>

<p class="i1">"Really, these allegories are charming, M. Fouquet,"
said Louis, with a covert sneer, turning
towards his host, and speaking in a loud voice, "but
allegories are not always truthful." Fouquet bowed
to the ground, and turned very pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">After having examined the interior of the château,
and partaken of a sumptuous refection, the King
was invited to pass into the garden to see the
illuminations.</p>

<p class="i1">There the whole horizon was aglow. On three
broad terraces, of the purest white marble, which
extended along the entire façade of the building,
rows of golden candelabra bore myriads of wax
lights. Rows of gigantic orange-trees, in full blossom,
shone with orbs of variegated light, that glittered
on the dark surface of the polished leaves.
Below, in a vast square, fashioned into a sunken
parterre of flowers, arranged in various patterns,
cunningly concealed lamps of every hue were hidden
among the leaves, their innumerable flamelets forming
a carpet of living fire. Jets of flame leaped from
tree to tree. Beyond the parterre, the broad canal
banks blazed and palpitated with fiery heat. The
waters, of a ruddy hue, now reflecting the gorgeous
scene, now riven into <i>jets d'eau</i> and fountains which
blaze upwards for an instant, throwing up clouds of
rockets that sport like comets among the stars, to
fall back in cascades of golden sparks. Beyond, in
the woods, each noble forest-tree, in minutest detail
of every branch and twig, stood out in relief against
what appeared a vault of fire. Long vistas led far
away among stalwart oaks and feathery limes, growing
out of a sea of flames. All around there was
nothing but fire—dazzling, overwhelming fire. Now
it turned to green, then by some magic touch it
changed to blue, then flashed into crimson; while
<i>feux de joie</i> and cannon roared from concealed batteries,
and shook the very air. Behind, the architectural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
lines of the château were marked by clusters
of golden lamps. Every room shone brighter than
at noon, and the central dome, with its graceful
colonnade, blazed like a volcano. On the terrace, in
front of the château, military bands clashed with
joyous symphonies. When these ceased, soft music
sounded from out the fiery woods, from violins and
flutes, swelling in the cadences of some tender
melody. The crowd below, changing with the metamorphose
of the lights, formed a fitting fore-ground
to this burning perspective. It was a scene of artificial
life after Lancret, backed by a conflagration.
Brocaded trains swept along the fine gravel of the
walks. Wreaths of diamonds sparkled on voluminous
wigs, which fell in heavy curls over neck and
shoulders. Long white feathers, and finest Brussels
lace, fringed and decked turned-up hats of velvet.
Glittering officers were side by side with comely
pages, brighter than butterflies. Gold embroideries
shone on delicately coloured velvets, satins, and
watered-silks; priceless jewels glittered on knee and
shoe, on neck and arm, on waist and drapery; torsades
on hats, and sword-hilts flashed and multiplied
the fiery marvels of the night. Even <i>le Grand
Monarque</i>, as he paused upon the terrace to observe
the scene, deigned to express his admiration and
surprise. But his praise was scant, his words cold,
he spoke morosely, and his brows were knit.</p>

<p class="i1">The more he investigated the magnificence of
Vaux, the more he believed the accusations of
Colbert. Fouquet heard the praise; he did not
observe the frown. He was radiant. Louis looked
round, anxious to escape from the glare and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
crowd. He longed to retire into some shady grove
with La Vallière. She was very beautiful that
evening. Louis reproached himself for ever having
caused her pain. She wore a dress of white stuff,
worked with golden leaves; a blue ribbon, tied in a
knot in front, encircled her small waist. Her light
hair, untouched by powder, and sown with flowers
and pearls, fell over her shoulders; two enormous
emeralds hung in her ears. Her arms were uncovered,
but to conceal their thinness, she wore above
the elbow a broad circlet of gold set with opals.
Her gloves were of fine Brussels lace, showing the
rosy skin beneath. Her graceful yet dignified
manners, her tender blue eyes, breathing nothing
but love and gentleness, her look of patient goodness,
were never more charming than when seen
among the painted and powdered belles of that
intriguing Court. It was impossible for Louis to
have a word with her in private. Every feminine
eye was bent upon him. All the ladies—young,
old, fair and dark—pressed round him as he moved
among the alleys and terraces of the illuminated
garden. He was the rose that attracted alike the
butterflies and the grubs—the sunshine and the
shadow. Like royalty of all ages, Louis soon grew
weary of this espionage, and called for the Duc de
Saint-Aignan. He was nowhere to be found. At
last, after having walked up and down the three
terraces, admired the great cascade and the grotto,
afterwards to be repeated at Saint-Cloud, he sought
out the Queen-mother. She was seated on the
terrace, surveying the illumination at a distance.
Louis leaned over the marble balustrade near her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"This is magnificent, my mother," said he; "so
magnificent that I believe every word Colbert has told
me. Colbert showed me peculations on paper; I see
them here with my own eyes. Think of the millions
he must have spent! Look at my palace of Saint-Germain—dilapidated,
dismal; Fontainebleau still
unfinished. It is shameful! Fouquet is a mushroom,
who has nourished himself out of my revenues. I can
crush him—I <i>will</i> crush him—destroy him!" and the
King stamped his foot savagely on a pavement of
coloured marbles.</p>

<p class="i1">"My son, do not speak so loudly," replied the
Queen.</p>

<p class="i1">At this moment Saint-Aignan appeared ascending
the steps from below.</p>

<p class="i1">"Where have you been, Duke?" asked Louis
sharply.</p>

<p class="i1">"A thousand pardons, your Majesty. They
searched for me in the wrong place. You will not,
however, have reason to regret my absence," and he
gave the King a look full of meaning, and signed to
him to move farther off from all possibility of listeners.
"Sire," continued he, "I have made a discovery."</p>

<p class="i1">"A discovery! Where? What have you found?"
and Louis drew closer to him.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, I fear you have a rival," and Saint-Aignan
glanced significantly at the Duchesse de la Vallière,
who sat on a settee behind, not far from the Queen-mother.</p>

<p class="i1">"A rival! Ridiculous! You have been asleep and
dreaming, Duke."</p>

<p class="i1">"No, Sire; on the faith of a peer of France, no.
Your Majesty has a rival, I repeat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"What do I care for rivals! I have her heart,"
and Louis glanced tenderly at La Vallière.</p>

<p class="i1">"But is your Majesty so certain?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Certain? Ask me if I live!" exclaimed Louis
with warmth. "But tell me what you mean. Speak,
Duke, and speak quickly, for we may be interrupted."</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, Sire, some fairy, who I suppose watches
over your interests, told me to wander over the
château and examine the more private chambers.
No one was by. Every one was in the garden with
your Majesty to see the illuminations. At the end
of a long gallery, in a distant part of the house, I
came upon a boudoir—such a bijou of a room!—evidently
belonging to Fouquet. On the walls hung
the portraits of some of the fairest ladies of the
Court. It is a hall of beauty, Sire."</p>

<p class="i1">"Go on," said Louis impatiently; "I understand."</p>

<p class="i1">"Among these beauties, Sire, was—well—there was
the lady you honour with your special attentions—Madame
la Duchesse—" and Saint-Aignan stopped,
and again indicated La Vallière, who, unconscious of
what was going on, sat near, her delicate cheek resting
on her hand.</p>

<p class="i1">"You need mention no names, Saint-Aignan. I
tell you, I understand," replied the King with evident
irritation. "And pray what does it matter if you did
find the portrait of that lady there? I see nothing
in it at all remarkable. No hall of beauty would be
complete without her likeness. Who were the other
portraits?"</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i-176.jpg" id="i-176.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i-176.jpg"
        alt="" />
  <div class="caption">COLBERT.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">"Ah, Sire, that is precisely the point I am coming
to. They were all portraits of ladies who are or have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
been the acknowledged mistresses of Fouquet. If
Madame la Duchesse de——"</p>

<p class="i1">"I beg you again not to mention any names,
Duke," broke in the King haughtily, a storm gathering
on his brow.</p>

<p class="i1">"If that lady, Sire, had not resembled the others,
why should she have been there?"</p>

<p class="i1">To this somewhat daring question Louis did not
vouchsafe a reply. His countenance darkened into an
expression of silent rage. His eyes glittered as he
passed his hand over them. When he spoke there
was doubt, anxiety, as well as anger in his voice and
manner. "I am astonished, I confess," said he, speaking
very deliberately. "I am quite at a loss to explain
it. Her portrait is there, you say. It may be, Saint-Aignan.
I cannot doubt your word, but—it is impossible
that——" He paused, and his eyes rested
on her guileless face.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, it is not for me to differ from your Majesty,"
rejoined Saint-Aignan, fearful lest he had injured
himself in the King's opinion by his over-frankness;
"your superior intellect and far-seeing judgment will
unfold to you mysteries impervious to my grosser
comprehension; but I repeat, in the boudoir of M.
Fouquet I saw the portrait of Madame La Duchesse—I
beg your Majesty's pardon—placed among those
of ladies whose relations with him are more than
equivocal."</p>

<p class="i1">"I will speak to the lady myself. She is ignorant
of this, I venture my life," said Louis, his eyes again
fixing themselves wistfully upon La Vallière. "In
the meantime, Duke, I thank you for your zeal
in my service. Now, remember, until our return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
to Fontainebleau <i>silence</i>—absolute silence—or I
shall never forgive you." Louis placed his finger
on his lip—Saint-Aignan, glad to end so perilous an
interview, bowed, and immediately fell back among
the crowd of courtiers who hovered about the King.</p>

<p class="i1">Louis's blood boiled within him. He had controlled
himself in the presence of Saint-Aignan, but
it was with the greatest difficulty he could any longer
restrain his passion. He longed then and there to
call in the musketeers, and arrest Fouquet on the
spot. D'Artagnan and his followers were at hand;
it would have been the work of an instant. At a
loss what to do, and feeling the necessity for some
expression of the violent rage he felt, he approached
his mother, Anne of Austria, who was leaning back
in her chair, absorbed in a deep reverie. She was
only present at that dazzling fête in body—her mind
was far away. To her the pomps and vanities of the
world were become a mockery and a toil; she longed
for the seclusion of the cloister.</p>

<p class="i1">"It is all over," whispered the King, and his voice
grated huskily in her ear; "Fouquet will be arrested
to-night."</p>

<p class="i1">"What has he done?" asked Anne of Austria.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have excellent reasons, my mother; besides,
Fouquet may escape to Belle Isle—here I have him,
I hold him!" and Louis, in his seat, shook his fist in
his mother's face.</p>

<p class="i1">"You are strangely moved, Louis. I do not know
your reasons, but I advise you, for the sake of your
own dignity, to choose a more suitable moment than
during a fête at which you are present in his own
house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Every time is good to catch a traitor."</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes; but, my son, there is such a thing as decorum.
The Superintendent has given you a superb
fête, which you have accepted. You are under his
roof; you cannot arrest him while you are his guest.
It is out of the question."</p>

<p class="i1">"But, my mother, I have reasons of state."</p>

<p class="i1">"Then they must wait. What would the Court—what
would France—say to such an act? Take care,
my son, that those who may never know your justification
do not condemn your act. Even <i>you</i> are not
above public opinion."</p>

<p class="i1">Louis did not reply, but the Queen-mother perceived
that her words had convinced him.</p>

<p class="i1">The Court returned to Fontainebleau in the same
order as it came.</p>

<p class="i1">A <i>lettre de cachet</i>, dated the day after the fête, consigned
Fouquet to the fortress of Pignerol. Louise
de la Vallière was enabled to soothe his Majesty's
suspicions, with regard to the portrait, by assuring
him that if his indignation had been aroused, her
feelings had been much more grossly outraged.</p>

and Margaret of Austria, his wife, married
to Louis XIII., King of France, surnamed the Just,
mother of Louis XIV., surnamed Dieudonné, and of
Philip of France, Duc d'Orléans, born September,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">These words stood at the head of a will which was
signed "<i>approved</i>, Louis." Anne of Austria has stood
before us from her fifteenth year until now; first, the
golden-haired girl, next the prosecuted wife, then the
stately regent, finally the devoted and conscientious
mother. And now her time has come; she is dying
at the Louvre. Her malady is a cancer in the breast,
long concealed, now aggravated by the ignorance of
quacks. Latterly it has become an open wound, the
seat of intense suffering. Her daintily nurtured body
and sensitive skin, which could not bear the touch of
any but the finest and softest linen, the delicate habits
of her daily life, her extreme refinement of mind and
person (not common in those days even among
princes), have come to this: "God punishes me in
that body which I have too carefully tended," she
said. But the Queen's mind had long been weaned
from the world, her once lofty spirit schooled to the
uses of adversity, and she bears her protracted sufferings
with admirable meekness and resignation. Her
face shrunken, drawn, and ashen, her frame bowed
with intense pain rather than the weight of years,
have lost all trace of their singular beauty; but the
hands and arms are still white, plump, and shapely.
To the last, her son Louis XIV. reverently kisses
those taper fingers that had fondly entwined themselves
among his clustering curls from boy to man.
As long as that silvery voice could make itself heard,
it was as a peacemaker and as a friend. When Maria
Theresa, her niece, complained to her of the King's
too apparent <i>liaison</i> with La Vallière, the dying
Queen stroked her cheek, and comforted her, praying
her to pardon the fire of youthful blood, and to remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
that Louis, if erring, both loved and respected
her. She reminded her, "that she [Maria Theresa] had
at least a much happier lot than her own." Overcome
by suffering during the long watches of the night,
when she could not sleep, she weeps; as the tears
roll down her wrinkled cheeks, Mademoiselle de
Beauvais wipes them away with her handkerchief.</p>

</div>

<p class="i1">"I do not really weep, <i>ma bonne</i>," said the dying
Queen; "these tears that I shed are forced from me
by intense anguish; you know I never cry." The
Archbishop d'Auch, seeing her condition, told her
plainly that the doctor despaired of her life.</p>

<p class="i1">"I thank God," she answered. "Do not lament,"
added she, turning to her ladies, whose sobs caught
her ear; "we must all die. I am still among you;
when I am gone, then grieve for me, not yet."</p>

<p class="i1">Her son, Philippe d'Orléans, sat constantly beside
her bed. While he was present she never allowed
herself to utter a complaint, but when he left her, she
turned to Madame de Motteville and said, "I suffer
horribly. There is no single part of my whole body
that is not rent with pain." Then raising her eyes
to heaven she exclaimed, "Praised be God, it is His
will, His will be done—I submit to it with all my
heart; yes, with all my heart." Yet in this condition
she took the liveliest interest in all that concerned
her sons and the King of Spain, and caused
every letter to be read aloud to her coming from
Madrid. Two nights before her death she bade
good-night to her children with a haste unusual to
her. It was because she did not wish them to witness
sufferings she could no longer conceal. As soon
as they were gone she desired that the litany of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Passion should be chanted throughout the weary
hours of the night. Now and then her groans interrupted
the solemn office. When her women strove
to mitigate her agony, she pushed them away,
saying,</p>

<p class="i1">"My vile body is given up to the justice of God.
I care not what becomes of it."</p>

<p class="i1">In the morning the King, of whom she was ever
devotedly fond, and who warmly returned her love,
remained many hours with her. That afternoon she
grew worse. During the night her son Monsieur hid
himself in the curtains of her bed, not to leave her,
as she had earnestly desired he would do. The
next morning, it was deemed advisable to administer
extreme unction. The King and Queen, Monsieur
d'Orléans, Madame his wife, and Mademoiselle de
Montpensier were present. They went out to meet
the Lord's body and to bear it to her. After she
had communicated, a heavenly expression spread
over her countenance, her eyes shone with unnatural
brilliancy, and the colour returned to her cheeks.</p>

<p class="i1">"Observe my dear mother," whispered the King,
who was standing at the foot of her bed, to Mademoiselle
de Beauvais, "I never saw her look more
beautiful." Then she called her children round her,
and solemnly blessed them. These four, her two
sons and their wives, knelt by her bedside. They
kissed her hands and shed tears of a common grief.
The curtains were then closed, that the Queen might
take a little rest. When they were undrawn, the
film of death had gathered on her eyes.</p>

<p class="i1">Beautiful Saint-Cloud, enfolded in softly undulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
hills, its sheeny lawns and majestic avenues
descending to the Seine, whose clear waters dance
and ripple below in the soft spring light;—Saint-Cloud,
with its dimpling uplands and lofty summits,
on whose topmost verge stands what was once a
Roman watch-tower, looking towards Lutetia, the
ancient Paris, now a Grecian temple called the Lanterne
de Diogène; Saint-Cloud, dense, leafy, forest-like;
yonder a deep glen, in which the morning
shadows lie; above, grassy meads of finest greensward,
where the primrose and the cowslip, the
anemone and the foxglove blossom under scattered
groups of noble trees, gay with every shade of green,
oaks yellow with new leaves; delicate beech and the
soft foliage of the tufted elm; all rising out of a sea
of paler tinted copsewood. Midway on the hill-side,
the ground suddenly falls; and the woods melt into
sculptured terraces, on which the spray of many
fountains catch and reflect the morning sun. These
terraces are again broken by a magnificent cascade,
which dashes downwards, to be presently engulfed
by the overhanging trees, before it falls into the
river.</p>

<p class="i1">It is early summer. The air is full of perfume.
The scent of new-made hay and the odour of dew-laden
flowers are wafted from the terraces towards the
palace, lying in the lowest lap of the hills, shut in by
hanging gardens, its pillared portico basking in the
sunshine.</p>

<p class="i1">From the days of Gondi, the Italian banker, the
friend of Zametti, who was more than suspected of
poisoning <i>la belle</i> Gabrielle—for both Gondi and
Zametti had country houses there—Saint-Cloud was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
a fair and pleasant place. Hither came Catherine de'
Medici to give great fêtes and banquets, and to visit
such of her countrymen as lived near the palace, all
of them skilful Italian Jews, dealing largely in money,
with which they were ready to supply the royal coffers,—on
exorbitant interest, be it well understood—who
received her with Oriental magnificence, and dressed
out height, the terrace, and garden with silken flags
and embroidered banners, in the Italian style, to do
her honour. Within the palace of Saint-Cloud was
struck down Henry III., the last of Catherine's sons,
the last prince of the royal house of Valois, by the
hand of Jacques Clément, the Dominican. Here
Henri Quatre was proclaimed king, and here, in due
process of time, came to live the Duc d'Orléans,
brother of Louis XIV. Philippe d'Orléans, once a
peevish child, is now a soft, effeminate gentleman.
In person he is the <i>replica</i> of the King, only in
fainter colours; a water-colour sketch of an original
design in oils. He lives among his favourites, whom
the world stigmatises as gamblers and scoundrels,
especially the Chevalier de Lorraine, who governs
Monsieur despotically.</p>

<p class="i1">All the world (except her husband) adores the
brilliant Henriette, Duchesse d'Orléans, his wife and
cousin-german, who, with her mother, Henrietta
Maria, suffered so much at the Louvre from poverty,
that they lay in bed for warmth. Now, her brother,
Charles II., sits on the throne of England, and she
loves not to have the days of her adversity recalled.
Henriette d'Orléans is not an absolute beauty. Like
her mother, her features are irregular, and her mouth
large, but her fresh English colouring tells well among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the olive-complexioned ladies of the Court. She is
tall, and eminently graceful. Her sunny smile, her
ready wit, her joyous manners, win every heart she
cares to gain. But, as we have seen, she can be both
haughty and cruel. Once she had hoped to marry
her elder cousin, the King; but the Mancini girls
stepped in, and she was forced to content herself
with his younger brother, Philip, whom she despises
and dislikes.</p>

<p class="i1">Now matters have grown worse than ever between
the spouses, for the Duke of Monmouth—illegitimate
son of Charles II. by Lucy Waters—has come to
Court, and does not conceal his admiration for his
English relative, nor observe those precise rules of
etiquette needful at the French Court. What makes
matters worse is, that Madame, exasperated by her
husband, is defiant, and publicly encourages his attentions.
Monsieur, weak-headed and irritable, complains
to everybody. He says he shall leave the
Court, unless Madame conducts herself better.
Madame rejoins that he only persecutes her because
she happens to be aunt to the Duke of Monmouth.
To spite Monsieur, she uses her influence with the
King, and Monsieur's favourite, the Chevalier de
Lorraine,—who whispers these tales about her into
her husband's ear,—is packed off; exiled to the sea-girt
fortress of the Château d'If, near Marseilles.
This aggravates Monsieur, who treats Madame worse
than ever. They have fresh quarrels every day, during
one of which Monsieur calls Madame a "<i>vaurienne</i>."
Even when they ride together in the King's
coach, Monsieur must insult and taunt his wife. "He
believes in astrology," he says, "and as his horoscope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
foretells he shall be the husband of many wives, and
Madame looks ill, he hopes he shall soon have a
change." At this rude speech Madame weeps, but
says nothing. All this is very bad, and creates such
a scandal that Louis interferes; he expostulates with
his brother.</p>

<p class="i1">The King, to give Madame a little respite, appointed
her at this time his ambassadress into England,
to treat with her brother, Charles II. In her
suite she carried the beautiful Bretonne, Louise de
la Querouaille, who became afterwards so well known
in this country as the Duchess of Portsmouth.</p>

<p class="i1">After a time Madame returns from England,
blooming in health and joyous in spirits. She cannot
bring herself even to affect common concern for
the death of her mother,—poor broken-down
Henrietta Maria,—who has just died from taking
an overdose of opium. Monsieur refuses to meet
his wife at Amiens, a public slight which nettled her
exceedingly, especially as the Chevalier de Lorraine
has returned from banishment, and is again at Saint-Cloud.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame is now twenty-six, and as strong and
healthy as any young woman can be. Very early
on a certain morning, in the first days of June, a page
rides out of the park gates of Saint-Cloud in furious
haste. He bears a message of life and death to the
King, who is at Saint-Germain. He spurs his steed
along the paved roads which lead from palace to
palace, along the heights. The word he carries is—<i>that
Madame is dying</i>. Never did messenger of evil
cause such consternation. The King flies to Saint-Cloud;
he loved the sweet princess. He is followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
by the Queen, accompanied by <i>la Grande Mademoiselle</i>.
When the royal coach draws up under the
grand portico, Valtot, the Court doctor, is there to
receive them. He says the illness of Madame is
nothing but a violent attack of colic, and is of no
consequence whatever. But this attack of colic had
seized Madame so suddenly she could not bear to be
carried to her own bed, but lay on a little couch in
a recess of one of the reception-rooms. A very
serious attack of colic, truly. When Maria Theresa
enters, she finds Madame in convulsions; her long
hair streaming over her face and pillow, her limbs
cramped, her body contorted, her nightgown unfastened
to relieve her breathing, her arms bare and
hanging out of the sleeves, her face bearing every
appearance of approaching death.</p>

<p class="i1">"You see what a state I am in," she whispers to
the Queen between the paroxysms. "Save me, oh,
save me—my sufferings are horrible!"</p>

<p class="i1">The Queen kisses her hand. Every one was
affected. The King leans over her with the utmost
affection.</p>

<p class="i1">"Surely," cries the King to Valtot, "you will not
let her die without help?"</p>

<p class="i1">Except the royal party no one seems to care
about her. Monsieur is quite indifferent. He
laughs and talks in the very room where she is
lying.</p>

<p class="i1">The end came soon. In a few hours, Madame
died in horrible agony. Her corpse immediately
turned black.</p>

<p class="i1">Louis XIV. is in his private closet at Saint-Germain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
He is in his <i>robe de chambre</i>, and he has
been weeping; three extraordinary events for the
King, not to hold his usual levee, to wear his <i>robe
de chambre</i>, and to weep.</p>

<p class="i1">A dreadful rumour has just reached him—the
words <i>poison</i> and <i>murder</i> have passed from mouth
to mouth about the Court. At last he has heard
them. What!—his beloved sister-in-law, she who
but two days before had danced with him in a ballet,
dressed as Aurora; she—the pride of his Court, the
cynosure of all eyes—poisoned! Oh, horrible! By
whom was this poison given? By his brother?
Impossible. By one of his disgraceful favourites
whom Madame hated? The Chevalier de Lorraine,
perhaps? Was he the murderer? The King cannot
brook suspense or delay. He sends privately for
Morel, the <i>maître d'hôtel</i> of his brother. Morel
comes trembling; he guesses the reason of the
summons.</p>

<p class="i1">"Morel," says the King in an unsteady voice, "I
have sent for you to tell me the truth. Now, on
pain of instant death, answer me. Who murdered
my sister-in-law? Presume not to equivocate or to
deceive me. Did the Duchess die by poison?"</p>

<p class="i1">"She did, your Majesty."</p>

<p class="i1">Louis shudders. "By whose order was it administered?"</p>

<p class="i1">"By the order of the Chevalier de Lorraine," answers
Morel. "Poison was put into a cup of chicorée-water,
the Duchess's usual beverage, by the hands
of the Marquis d'Effiat. Before God, your Majesty,
I am innocent of all save the knowledge of this
crime."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Louis, seeing that Morel is about to cast himself
on his knees before him, by a stern gesture forbade
it. He then motions him to proceed.</p>

<p class="i1">"The Duchess, Sire, complained of thirst; soon
after a cup of chicorée-water—the cup of porcelain,
which her Highness always used—was presented;
she drank its contents to the last drop. Soon after
she was seized with convulsions. Your Majesty
knows the rest."</p>

<p class="i1">There is a pause. "Tell me," asks Louis, speaking
with a great effort, "tell me, had my brother—had
the Duc d'Orléans any part in this crime?"</p>

<p class="i1">"I believe not, Sire," answers Morel, shaking from
head to foot, for the King's looks are not reassuring.
"They dared not trust him; he would have betrayed
them. But it was believed that the death of Madame
would not be——"</p>

<p class="i1">"Answer as I desire you, sir. Answer the questions
I address to you, nothing more," interrupts
the King, scowling at him, at the same time greatly
relieved by hearing that his brother was not an
accomplice. "I have heard what I want to know.
I am satisfied. I will spare your life, wretched man,"
and he turns from Morel with disgust, "because you
have spoken the truth; but you must leave France
for ever. Remember, the honour of princes is in your
hand, and that wherever you fly, their vengeance
can pursue you. Therefore, be silent, if you value
your life."</p>

<p class="i1">The King dared investigate no further; too foul a
picture of his brother's life would have been revealed
to public curiosity. The death of this charming,
though frivolous princess, remained unavenged, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
murderers unpunished, and she was soon forgotten
in the dissipation of a Court where the Sovereign set
an example of the most heartless egotism.</p>

<p class="i1">As for Monsieur, nothing daunted by the suspicions
attached to his name, and although believed by
many to have been a direct accomplice in Henriette's
death, he determined to bring home a fresh wife to
Saint-Cloud and the Palais Royal. This he did in
the person of a German princess (ever the refuge of
unfortunate royalty in search of wives), a formidable
she-dragon rather, by name Charlotte de Bavière,
a lady certainly well able to defend herself in case of
need. What a contrast to the feminine, fascinating
Henriette! Charlotte's autobiography remains to us,
a lasting evidence of her coarseness of mind and of
body. This is the opening page:—</p>

<p class="i1">"I am naturally rather melancholy. When anything
annoys me, I have always an inflammation in
my left side, as if I had a dropsy. Lying in bed is
not at all my habit. As soon as I wake I must get
up. I seldom take breakfast. If I do, I only eat
bread and butter. I neither like chocolate, coffee,
nor tea. Foreign drugs are my horror. I am entirely
German in my habits, and relish nothing in the way
of food but the <i>cuisine</i> of my own country. I can
only eat soup made with milk, beer, or wine. As to
<i>bouillon</i>, I detest it. If I eat any dish that contains
it, I am ill directly, my body swells, and I am fearfully
sick. Nothing but sausages and ham restore
the tone of my stomach. I always wanted to be a
boy," this extraordinary "Princess" continues, "and
having heard that Marie Germain became one by
continually jumping, I used to take such fearful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
leaps, that it is a miracle I did not break my neck a
thousand times."</p>

<p class="i1">This was the mother of the Regent Orléans.</p>

<p class="i1">Charlotte de Bavière was walking one evening
alone in the dusk through the almost interminable
suite of rooms which encircled the four garden fronts
of the Palais Royal. Many of these rooms had been
constantly inhabited by her predecessor, Madame
Henriette. It was stormy weather, and the gathering
clouds were rapidly darkening what little daylight
was left. The wind moaned among the branches
of the trees without; it whistled through the rooms
within, swaying the rich curtains to and fro. The
shutters were not yet closed. The Duchess wandered
on from room to room until she reached a remote
apartment on the ground-floor, which had been
much frequented by Madame Henriette—a garden
pavilion opening by large windows and a flight of
steps to a parterre. At this window Charlotte stood
watching the clouds passing over the moon which
had just risen, as they were drifted rapidly onwards,
driven by the wind. How long she remained there
she could never tell. All at once a slight sound behind
her, like the rustling of drapery along the floor,
caught her ear. She turned, and saw advancing from
the door towards the spot where she stood a white
figure, wearing the form of the late Duchess, her
predecessor, Henriette of England. She knew her
instantly from her portraits. What passed between
these two—the dead and the living wife—never was
told. Charlotte, all her life long, insisted on the perfect
truth of this story, but would say nothing more.
In time it came to be understood that some awful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
secret connected with the Orléans family, only to be
known to the head of the house, was revealed by the
phantom.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Duchesse Louise de la Vallière, after her
return from Chaillot, lived much at the Hôtel
Biron, a residence at Versailles presented to her by
the King. Her two children, the Comte de Vermandois
and Mademoiselle de Blois, were with her. The
Hôtel Biron, a sumptuous abode, situated between
"court and garden," lay in a hollow close to the yet
unfinished Palace of Versailles, on the same side as
the reservoir. Adjoining were the royal gardens, already
planned and partially completed by Le Nôtre.
These gardens, with the formal groves and symmetrical
thickets which enclose them, sloped downwards
from the grand terrace of the southern front,
and overshadowed the hôtel, giving it a sequestered,
not to say melancholy aspect. On the other side a
wooded park stretched away in the direction of what
was in time to become the site of the two Trianons.
The new Palace of Versailles was as yet covered with
scaffolding; innumerable workmen laboured night
and day on the north and south wings. The <i>corps
de logis</i>, of brick and stone, was alone completed, and
though greatly enlarged and beautified, still retained
those suites of small rooms—<i>les petits apartements</i>—portions
of the original hunting-lodge, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
so often visited by Louis XIII. in his hunting expeditions.</p>

</div>

<p class="i1">La Vallière lived a life of extreme retirement.
She rarely appeared at Court, except upon occasions
of state, and received only such visits as etiquette
rendered necessary. Save the King, her confessor,
and a few intimate friends, she avoided every one.
The splendour of the retreat assigned her by the
King pained and humiliated her. She was but too
conscious that in permitting herself to be dowered
and ennobled by him, she was exposing herself to the
charge of ambition, arrogance, and avarice—she, who
only loved the man, and who shrank abashed from
the sovereign!</p>

<p class="i1">The very letters-patent by which Louis created
her Duchesse de la Vallière infinitely wounded her.
It was intolerable to her to be publicly addressed as
"his singularly and entirely beloved Louise Françoise
de la Vallière, possessed of his Majesty's special
and particular affection." Vainly had she endeavoured
to combat his resolution thus to distinguish
her; vainly had she entreated him to allow her to
sink into oblivion, forgotten by all save himself.
Louis had declared, and with truth, that after her
flight to Chaillot and her return to Saint-Germain,
all mystery was impossible. He could not bear, he
told her, to see her continually suffering affronts and
mortifications in his own Court, to which her sensitive
nature specially exposed her, and from which even
he could not screen her.</p>

<p class="i1">Vainly did he invoke all his authority as a sovereign,
all his devotion as a man, to raise the object of
his love beyond the reach of calumny. Vainly did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
he surround her with all that the luxury of kings, the
treasures of the state, and the refinements of love
could devise to reconcile her to her position. He
could not stifle her conscience. Louise could not
bring herself to leave him, but she sank under the
consciousness of her sin.</p>

<p class="i1">When, by a formal declaration of the parliament,
her children were legitimatised and created princes
of the blood royal, she was in absolute despair.
Again she conjured the King never more to let her
name be heard. But, selfish even to her, Louis commanded
that she should appear in the Queen's circle,
and receive the congratulations of the Court. A
prey to anxiety and remorse, silent, yearning, solitary,
her health gave way. Her lovely figure lost its
roundness, her violet eyes their lustre. She grew
dull, oppressed, and tearful, and her lameness increased.</p>

<p class="i1">The Comtesse du Roule, formerly maid of honour
to Madame Henriette d'Orléans at the same time as
La Vallière, was one of the few friends she still received.</p>

<p class="i1">They had not met for some time when Madame du
Roule called on her. Madame du Roule found
Louise seated alone in a pavilion overlooking the
palace of Versailles. She was so lost in thought she
did not hear her friend's footsteps. When she rose
to receive her she looked more delicate and dejected
than usual.</p>

<p class="i1">"Dear Louise," said the Comtesse after having
saluted her, "how I grieve to see you so unhappy.
Can nothing be done to console you? Remember
you are ruining your looks. Do you imagine that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
his Majesty will care for you when you have made
yourself wrinkled and ugly?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas, Celestine, I cannot help it! I ought not to
be here", and Louise kissed her tenderly, and placed
her on a seat beside her. "This magnificent hotel,
those royal servants, my luxurious life—daily remind
me of my degradation. While I was unknown and
poor, lost among the crowd of a great Court, I was
my own mistress. My heart was my own to bestow.
Now," and she placed her hand on her heart as if
she suffered "a price seems put upon me. I cannot
bear it! Ah, why did I leave Chaillot?" and her
head, covered with light baby curls, sank upon her
bosom; and she heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p class="i1">"But, Louise, if you love the King," said the Comtesse,
laying her hand gently on that of La Vallière,
"you must accept the inevitable position, else some
one less scrupulous and more mercenary than yourself
will certainly take it."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, Celestine, that fear is ever present to me.
It is agony to me; it keeps me here. Do not imagine
that I misunderstand my position. I suffer because
it is too painfully evident. Yet I love the King too
much to resign him. Love! ah, more—I worship
him!" and she raised her head, and an inner light
shone from her soft grey eyes, that made them glow
with passion. "Is he not my master—my sovereign!"
she continued; "am I not bound to obey
him? Could I exist without him? Who else but
Louis could have brought me back from Chaillot?
Who else could have torn me from the altar to which
my heart still clings? Celestine, I know I shall return
to that convent."—The Comtesse smiled incredulously.—"But,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
continued La Vallière, "when
I see my faded face in the glass, and I know I am
faded and changed,"—Madame du Roule shook her
head deprecatingly—"I tremble—oh, I tremble lest
I should lose him! I know I ought to rejoice at his
loss," added she in a broken voice; "yet I cannot—I
cannot!" and the tears streamed from her eyes,
and she covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p class="i1">"Have you perceived any difference in the behaviour
of his Majesty of late?" asked Madame du
Roule, when La Vallière became more composed.</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, what a question, Celestine! Such an idea
never crossed my mind—changed now, at this time—could
it be possible? When I spoke of losing
him, I meant in the course of years—long, long
years. Surely he would not change now?" An
agonised expression came into her face as she spoke,
and she turned appealingly towards her friend for
reassurance against what presented itself to her as
some horrible dream.</p>

<p class="i1">"I only ask you this question for your good, dear
Louise," answered the Comtesse soothingly, imprinting
a kiss on her pallid cheek. La Vallière threw
her arms around her neck, and made no reply. "I
see you are incapable of judging for yourself. If
I ask a painful question, it is to spare you, not to
wound you. Answer me honestly, Louise—is his
Majesty changed?"</p>

<p class="i1">A shudder passed over the slender frame of La
Vallière. For a time she could not bring herself to
reply; then hesitatingly she answered: "I have fancied—but,
oh heavens! may it be only a fancy—that
his Majesty finds his visits to me more dull than formerly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
I am so depressed myself, that must be the
reason," and she bent her eyes upon her friend, hoping
that she would assent; but Madame du Roule
only listened with grave attention. "He has sat,"
continued Louise, evidently forcing herself to a painful
confession, "he has sat for half an hour at a time
quite silent, a thing unusual with him. He has remarked,
too, repeatedly, on my altered looks; he has
often regretted my low spirits. He is most considerate,
most tender; but"—and she faltered more
than ever—"I fear that I depress him; and I have
tried—" here her voice dropped, and her eyes fixed
themselves upon a medallion portrait of Louis that
hung round her neck by a chain of gold. She contemplated
it earnestly.</p>

<p class="i1">"That is just what I feared, Louise," and the
Comtesse laid her hand softly on her shoulder to
rouse her from the deep reverie into which she had
fallen; "that is precisely what I feared. If you
cease to amuse the King, others will; he will leave
you."</p>

<p class="i1">"Holy Virgin!" cried Louise, starting from her
chair and clasping her hands; "do not say so; such
an idea is death to me!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Louise, be calm; reseat yourself, and listen to
me. You rarely go to Court; but you well know
that his Majesty is surrounded from morning till
night with crowds of most fascinating, most unscrupulous
women. They follow him like his shadow;
he cannot shake them off—even if he would. The
poor Queen, who is as stupid as an owl, sits in a
corner, sighs, and sulks, or plays at cards, and loses
thousands to pass away the time. But she says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
nothing, and has no influence whatever over her husband.
By-the-way, she is very jealous of you, Louise,
and calls you 'the lady with the diamond ear-rings.'"</p>

<p class="i1">La Vallière blushed, then sighed; and again her
dreamy eyes sought the medallion portrait of the
King, which she still held within the palm of her
hand.</p>

<p class="i1">"Rouse yourself, Louise; believe me there is
need," urged the Comtesse. "When the King visits
you next, throw off these gloomy vapours; or, if
you cannot, invite some friend to be present and
assist you in entertaining him."</p>

<p class="i1">The tears gathered in La Vallière's eyes, and
slowly coursed each other down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas! has it come to this, then? Do you indeed,
Celestine, counsel me to call on another to do
that which was once my privilege? How he once
loved my company! how he praised my gentleness
and my timidity, which charmed him inexpressibly,
he said, after the boldness of the ladies of the
Court."</p>

<p class="i1">"All this is folly," said Madame du Roule impatiently.
"The King is robust, happy, and fond of
pleasure. He delights in the society of women.
You must, Louise, either return to Chaillot, as you
say you desire to do (excuse my frankness, dear, it
is for your good), or you must change. His Majesty
is neither a penitent, nor ill, nor sad. Do you know
any one you can invite here when he comes?"</p>

<p class="i1">"No," replied La Vallière with a look of infinite
distress upon her plaintive face. "No one I could
trust. Besides, the King might resent it as a liberty.
It is a matter needing the nicest judgment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"The person, whoever she is," said Madame du
Roule, "must be sincerely attached to you, polished,
agreeable, and sympathetic. She must be good-looking,
and not too old, either; for the King loves
youth and beauty. There is the new lady-in-waiting,
the Marquise de Montespan. You have seen
her. She is a mere girl, just come to Court, and
belongs to no clique. She is as witty as a Mortémart
ought to be, and gloriously handsome. Such
eyes, dear Louise, such colour! and there is plenty
of fun, not to say malice, about her. I would not
have her for an enemy! When she was presented
to the Queen, there was the most extraordinary
sensation at Court—people stood on chairs to look
at her."</p>

<p class="i1">"But, dear Celestine, what a hag I shall look beside
this fresh young beauty?" cried La Vallière in
alarm.</p>

<p class="i1">"You need have no fear of that. The King is
perhaps the only man in the whole circle who does
not admire her. You would be quite safe to invite
her. She is full of badinage, positively a child in her
love of amusement; her lively sallies will help to pass
the time. She desires, too, greatly to be presented to
you, and has already conceived a romantic friendship
for you."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, Celestine, are you sure that this girl, this
Mortémart—they are a dangerous family—seeks me
for myself alone? Are you sure that she has no
deeper motive for all these professions? I confess I
have my misgivings."</p>

<p class="i1">"You are quite mistaken, Louise. She is a naïve
creature, clever indeed, but guileless. You could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
make a better choice. Take my advice, ask his
Majesty's permission to invite the Marquise next time
he comes. Believe me, he is perfectly indifferent to
her. He will be grateful to you for the attention; he
will be amused. You will find him return to his first
ardour, he will be as devoted as at first. You will
recover your spirits; you will return to Court" (La
Vallière shook her head sadly), "and all will be well!"</p>

<p class="ac">MADAME DE MONTESPAN.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-a.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap " />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ATHANAISE DE MORTÉMART, Marquise de
Montespan, the most beautiful woman of her
age, was, at this time, twenty-two years old. She
was fair, but not so fair as La Vallière. Her features
were faultless, and there was an aureole of youth and
freshness about her that made her irresistible. She
affected to be careless, impulsive, even infantine;
but she was in reality profoundly false, and could be
insolent, cruel, and domineering; a syren or a fury,
as suited her humour or her purpose. There was no
mercy in those voluptuous eyes that entranced while
they deceived; no truth in those coral lips that
smiled only to betray.</p>

<p class="i1">No sooner was she informed that the Duchesse de
la Vallière would receive her, than she flew to the
Hôtel Biron. Louise was astounded at her extraordinary
beauty.</p>

<p class="i1">"How much I thank you, Marquise, for your goodness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
in sparing a few hours from the gaieties of the
Court to visit a poor recluse like me."</p>

<p class="i1">"On the contrary, Madame la Duchesse, it is I
who am grateful"; and the Marquise kissed her on
both cheeks. "Ever since I came to Court, I have
longed to become acquainted with you. No words
can express the love and respect I entertain for you."</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas! madame, I fear that you cannot know me.
I deserve no respect," replied La Vallière sadly. "If
you can love me, I shall be satisfied."</p>

<p class="i1">"Love you, dear Duchess! I will devote my life
to you, if you will permit me such an honour," cried
Madame de Montespan, her eyes flashing with eagerness.
"Will you allow me to look on you as an old
friend?"</p>

<p class="i1">"I shall consider it a privilege," replied La Vallière.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have so often talked about you with the Comtesse
du Roule, that I feel already as though we were
long acquainted," continued Madame de Montespan;
and she seized La Vallière's small hand and pressed
it. La Vallière returned her caress more quietly.
"Dear Duchess," exclaimed De Montespan impulsively,
"I am so young, so inexperienced."</p>

<p class="i1">"And so beautiful," added La Vallière, smiling.</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, I am told so, madame. Your counsel will
be invaluable to me. I am yet but a novice at
Court."</p>

<p class="i1">"I will be a mother to you," replied Louise meekly.
But, in her inmost heart, she asked herself, "Am I
indeed so old, so changed, that she can accept this
offer from me? It seems but yesterday I was as
young and as light-hearted as herself!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"I know little of the Court now," replied La Vallière,
speaking in a very subdued voice. "What I
do know, can be of little service to you. Heaven
guard you from my experiences!" and a deep sigh
escaped her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Madame la Duchesse, wherever you are, <i>there</i>
is the Court. Your modesty only adds to your merit.
We all know <i>you</i> are the dispenser of all favour, all
power—that your word is law." This was spoken
rapidly by the Marquise, who all the while kept her
eyes on the Duchess to study the effect of her flattery.</p>

<p class="i1">"God forbid," replied La Vallière coldly; and a
look of displeasure contracted her brow for an instant.
"I possess no power of that kind, madame.
I would never permit myself to exercise any such
influence over his Majesty, I assure you."</p>

<p class="i1">The crafty Marquise saw she had made a mistake,
and instantly set about repairing it. She sighed,
affected an air of deep concern, and cast down her
magnificent eyes. Then she timidly stretched out
her hand to clasp that of La Vallière.</p>

<p class="i1">"Will you teach me your patience, your resignation?
Will you teach me to bear sorrow?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Gracious heavens! what can a creature so young
and brilliant know of sorrow?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Much. Alas! too much!" The beautiful Marquise
raised her handkerchief to her eyes. "Monsieur
de Montespan never loved me. It was a marriage
arranged by my sister, Madame de Thiange.
She sacrificed me to family arrangements; he to
his love of play—he is a desperate gambler. Worse
still, he is a libertine." She paused, and tried to
blush. "Can I, dare I hope, Madame la Duchesse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
to find a friend in you? Nay more—a protectress?
May I be permitted to ask your counsel?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Reckon on me," cried La Vallière, who was
deeply interested in this artful appeal. Madame
de Montespan cared no more for her husband than
he did for her. "Come to me whenever you need
advice, whenever you want sympathy or protection.
Come to me freely—at all hours, at all times—this
house is yours."</p>

<p class="i1">"But, Madame la Duchesse, his Majesty may perhaps
object to my presence here. I do not think
he likes me. He has scarcely once addressed me
during the few times I have been at Court."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, I will arrange that," answered La Vallière,
her face all aglow with excitement. "I will manage
that you shall be here when he comes. To see
you, dear Marquise, as I do now, must be to esteem
and respect you. His Majesty's heart is so excellent,
all his ideas so great, so noble! You shall
help me to entertain him; you have such charming
spirits, such a sunny smile."</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Montespan gave a little start. She
could with difficulty conceal the delight this speech
gave her, La Vallière had so completely fallen into
the trap she had laid. Again she kissed her thin
white hand, and pressed the long delicate fingers
laid confidingly in her own.</p>

<p class="i1">"What an honour!" she exclaimed. "How
happy I shall be to serve you in the smallest way,
in return for all your goodness!"</p>

<p class="i1">"To serve <i>me</i>!" repeated La Vallière, gazing at
her vacantly. "Not to serve me—that is impossible.
Ah, no one can serve <i>me</i>. My life is a long remorse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
I love—with my whole soul I love. That love is a
crime. I can neither leave the King nor can I bear
to remain. God's image rises up within me to shut
out his dear form from my eyes. Alas, alas!—I
prefer him to God." La Vallière melted into tears.
She sank back on her chair, lost to all else but the
agony of her own feelings.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Montespan observed her with a look
of sarcastic scrutiny. No shade of pity tempered
her bold stare. Her eyes were hard as steel, her
full lips were compressed.</p>

<p class="i1">"How I admire your devotion to his Majesty,"
she said, in the most insinuating voice. "It is extraordinary."
Her kind words singularly belied her
cruel expression, but Louise, blinded by her tears,
did not observe this. "What astonishes me is that,
feeling as you do, you can endure to remain here—so
close to the palace, almost living in the Court, so
long. In such magnificence too,"—and she gave a
spiteful glance round the superbly decorated saloon.
"You must have extraordinary self-command," she
added artfully, "immense self-denial. I suppose
you see his Majesty often, Madame la Duchesse?"
she asked this question with well-affected indifference,
fixing her eyes steadily on poor La Vallière,
who still lay back in her chair, weeping. "He is
always at Versailles. It must be a great trial, and
with your religious convictions too." As she spoke
she carefully noted the effect each word produced
upon La Vallière.</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas!" replied her victim, her cheeks now suffused
with a burning blush, "I see him almost daily.
Those hours are all that render life endurable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Do you really mean this, dear Duchess?" returned
Madame de Montespan, feigning extreme
surprise. "I should have imagined that the refinement
of your nature would have rendered the indulgence
of a guilty passion impossible."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah! I see you despise me," groaned poor La
Vallière, overcome by shame. "I cannot wonder.
Young and pure as you are, I must be to you an
object of horror."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Madame la Duchesse, what a word! On
the contrary, I admire the sacrifice you make."</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas!" interrupted La Vallière, "it is no sacrifice.
I cannot tear myself from him because—because—"
she stopped for a moment, then added
hastily, "I fear to give him pain. It seems to me I
ought to bear anything rather than hurt one whose
love has raised me so near himself. I have not the
courage to wound him—perhaps to embitter his
whole life. No, although conscience, duty, religion
command it, I have not the courage." La Vallière
turned aside and hid her face.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Montespan fell into a deep muse. Again
an expression of cruel determination passed
over her fair young face, and she gave La Vallière a
glance in which malice, anger, and contempt were
mingled. La Vallière, absorbed in her own sorrow,
did not perceive it.</p>

<p class="i1">"How I grieve for you, dear friend," Madame de
Montespan continued, speaking in her sweetest
voice. "How I respect your scruples. Are you
sure," added she, carefully noting the effect of her
words, "that the King would <i>really</i> suffer from
your absence as keenly as you imagine!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"I have never dared broach the subject," answered
La Vallière, looking up. "My remorse I
cannot hide. He knows I suffer, he sees I am ill.
But I would not for worlds openly acknowledge
that I wish to forsake him."</p>

<p class="i1">"Yet, dear Duchess, this struggle will kill you.
What a balm to your sensitive feelings the solitude
of a convent would be! Among those holy sisters,
in a life of prayer, you would find new life."</p>

<p class="i1">"I know it—I know!" cried La Vallière, passionately;
"but how to leave him—how to go?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Perhaps, Duchess, I may assist you," and
Madame de Montespan bent, with well simulated
interest, over the slight form beside her, and gazed
inquiringly into the trusting eyes that were turned
so imploringly upon her. "I might be able to place
this dilemma before his Majesty as your friend, dear
Duchess. A third party is often able to assist in a
matter so delicate. If his Majesty would indeed
suffer as poignantly as you imagine, your departure
is out of the question. I could at least learn this
from himself in your interest."</p>

<p class="i1">Louise sprang to her feet, she threw her soft
arms round Madame de Montespan, and nestled her
pale face on her bosom.</p>

<p class="i1">"At last I have found a real friend," she cried;
"at last I have found one who understands me.
But," and she looked up quickly into the other's
face, with a confidence that was most touching,
"you will say nothing to his Majesty. Not a word.
Be here when he next comes. (I will ask his permission.)
You will then be able to judge for yourself—to
counsel me. I would rather suffer torture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
I would rather die, than give him a moment's pain,
remember that," and La Vallière put out her little hand
and pressed that of Madame de Montespan,
whose face was wreathed with smiles.</p>

<p class="i1">"Do you think his Majesty will consent to my
presence here?" asked Madame de Montespan,
carefully concealing her feelings of exultation, for
she foresaw what the reply must be.</p>

<p class="i1">"I will make him," cried La Vallière. "I will
teach you exactly how to please him—what to say—never
to contradict him—to watch the turn of his
eye, as I do. The ice once broken, your tact, your
winning manners, will make all easy."</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Montespan acquiesced. She strove
to appear careless, but she knew that her fate was
on the balance. If she met the King there, she was
resolved her rival should not long trouble her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Then you will tell me what I ought to do," continued
La Vallière. "I shall be for ever grateful to
you—you will reconcile me to myself!"</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">When next the King visited La Vallière, Madame
de Montespan was present. She was as plainly
dressed as was consistent with etiquette. At first
she said little, sat apart, and only spoke when the
King addressed her. But afterwards, gradually
feeling her way, she threw in the most adroit
flattery, agreed with all he said, yet appeared to
defer in everything to La Vallière. Sometimes she
amused him by her follies, and brought with her a
team of mice she had tamed and harnessed to a little
car of filigree, to run upon a table; sometimes she
astonished both La Vallière and the King by her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
acute observation, her daring remarks, and pungent
satire. The King's visits to the Hôtel Biron became
longer and more frequent. If Madame de Montespan
was not there he asked for her, and expressed
regret at her absence. The Comtesse du Roule
inquired anxiously of La Vallière if Madame de
Montespan was useful to her. Reports had reached
her which made her uneasy. It was said that this
beautiful young friend, whom she had so unwittingly
introduced to La Vallière, had designs of her own
upon the King; and that she openly boasted that
she would speedily supplant the Duchess.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame du Roule had also heard that Monsieur
de Montespan had appeared at the Queen's circle
dressed entirely in black, and that on being asked
by the King for what relative he wore such deep
mourning, had replied—</p>

<p class="i1">"For my wife, Sire."</p>

<p class="i1">La Vallière laughed at this story, and would not
listen to a syllable against her new friend.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was evening. The day had been intensely hot.
Now, stormy clouds scud across the western
skies, and the sun sets in a yellow haze, which lights
up the surrounding woods. Groups of stately elms
that tuft the park cast deep shadows upon the grass;
their huge branches sway to and fro in the rising
wind, which moans among the thickets of laurels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and lilacs separating the grounds of the Hôtel Biron
from the royal gardens of Versailles.</p>

<p class="i1">Louise la Vallière sat alone in a gorgeous boudoir
lined with mirrors and gilding. She was engaged
on some embroidery. As she stooped over
the frame on which her work was strained, her countenance
bore that resigned and plaintive expression
habitual to it. She was still graceful and pretty,
and her simple attire gave her the appearance of a
girl.</p>

<p class="i1">As the failing light warned her that night was
approaching, she put aside her work, seated herself
beside an alcoved window which opened upon a terrace,
and listened to the wind, each moment growing
more boisterous among the neighbouring forests
that topped the hills towards Saint-Cloud.</p>

<p class="i1">Suddenly the door opened, and Madame de Montespan
appeared. After saluting La Vallière, she
seated herself in an easy-chair opposite to her. Her
bearing was greatly changed. No longer subservient
and flattering, she was now confident, familiar,
and domineering. Her eyes wandered round the
room with a defiant expression. The very tone of
her voice showed how much she assumed upon the
consciousness of favour. She was more beautiful
than ever; many jewels adorned her neck and hair
which she had never worn before.</p>

<p class="i1">"Louise," said she, with an air which, if intended
to be gracious, was only patronising, "I can only
stay for an instant. How dismal you look! what is
the matter?"</p>

<p class="i1">Louise shook her head despondingly. "Nothing
more than usual."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"The Queen is just arrived from Saint-Germain;
I am in attendance. I escaped for a few minutes,
accompanied by the Comte de Lauzun. We came
through the gardens and the thicket by the private
alley. You must not ask me to stay; her Majesty
may inquire for me. Lauzun is waiting outside on
the terrace by the new fountain."</p>

<p class="i1">"Will he not come in?" asked La Vallière.</p>

<p class="i1">"No, he is in attendance on his Majesty, who is
engaged at this moment with the architect. He
may call for him at any moment."</p>

<p class="i1">"Do you think I shall see his Majesty this evening?"
asked La Vallière timidly, looking up and
meeting the haughty stare of the Marquise.</p>

<p class="i1">"I imagine not. It is late, and his Majesty has
said nothing of such an intention."</p>

<p class="i1">"Yet he is so near," murmured Louise sadly.</p>

<p class="i1">"Monsieur de Lauzun tells me that the flotilla of
boats is ordered for this evening. There is to be a
water party on the canal; the shores are to be illuminated.
I trust it will not rain."</p>

<p class="i1">"How I envy you—not the water party, but that
you will see the King," and La Vallière's eyes
glistened.</p>

<p class="i1">"Adieu, adieu, <i>ma belle</i>! I can't keep Lauzun
waiting," and Madame de Montespan rose and left
the boudoir as hastily as she had entered it.</p>

<p class="i1">Louise had also risen to attend her to the door.
She did not reseat herself, but stood gazing wistfully
after her. She anxiously bent her ear to catch
every sound. Louis was close at hand; he might
still come. A thrill of joy shot through her at the
thought. Once the sound of footsteps was audible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and a flush of delight overspread her face. The
sound died away, and again the night wind, sighing
without, alone broke the silence. Her heart sank
within her. She rebuked herself, but in vain; spite
of remorse, spite of self-conflicts, Louis was dearer
to her than life.</p>

</div>

<p class="i1">It was rapidly growing dusk; only a little light
still lingered in the room. A feeling of utter loneliness,
a foreboding of coming misfortune, suddenly
overcame her. The shadows of approaching night
seemed to strike into her very soul. She started at
her own footstep as she crossed the parquet floor
towards a taper which stood upon a marble table,
covered with costly trifles given to her by the King.
She stretched out her hand to light it. When she
had done so, something sparkled on the floor close
to the chair on which Madame de Montespan had
been seated. Louise stooped down to see what it
was. She at once recognised some golden tablets
which she had often noticed in the hands of Madame
de Montespan. The diamonds, set in the rich gold
chasing, and the initials, had caught the light. The
snap was open. It was so dark that La Vallière held
it close to the taper in order to close the spring. In
doing so the tablets fell open—her eyes fixed themselves
on the pages. An expression of horror came
into them as she gazed. Could it be, or was she
dreaming? All the blood in her body rushed to her
heart. She put down the light which she had held,
and, with the tablets in her hand, sat down to collect
her senses, for her head was dizzy. Could it be?
Yes; it was the handwriting of the King. How
well she knew it—each stroke, every little turn of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the pen, how she had studied it! As she passed
page after page through her quivering fingers, each
bore the same well-known characters. She tried to
read; a film gathered over her eyes. Yet she must
read on. She pressed her hand upon her brow; her
brain seemed on fire. At length a desperate resolution
gave her power—she read. There were verses
of passionate fondness, signed "Louis." The first
dated three months back; the last only yesterday.</p>

<p class="i1">She would have wept, but the tears froze ere they
reached her eyes. With a great effort she collected
her scattered senses and began to think. Madame de
Montespan must have dropped these tablets on purpose.
She saw it all. They fell from her hand upon
the floor. Lying there she gazed at them in silence.
Then she glanced round the room. It was now quite
dark; the burning taper only served to deepen the
gloom—Louise knew she was alone in the world; the
King loved another.</p>

<p class="i1">With the composure of despair she took up a pen
to address him before she fled, for fly she intuitively
felt she must. She was not capable of reflection, but
it came to her quite naturally as the only thing that
remained for her to do, to fly; and where could she
go but to Chaillot, to the dear sisterhood?</p>

<p class="i1">"You have ceased to love me," she wrote; "the
proofs are in my hand, written by yourself. The
last time we met you told me how dear I was to
you; let me never hear your beloved voice speak
another language. I do not reproach you; you
have treated me as I deserved. But I still love
you as when we first met among the woods of
Fontainebleau. If ever you waste a thought upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
me, remember that death alone can quench that
love."</p>

<p class="i1">Alas for the weakness of human nature! La Vallière,
once within the walls of Chaillot, shut herself
into the same cell she had before occupied, and repented
that she had come. "I ought to have seen
the King, and to have questioned him myself. Madame
de Montespan may have purposely deceived
me. That she must be false I know too well. Who
can tell if it is not all a device to rob me of Louis?
I may myself be but a tool in her hands. If I had
seen him, all might have been explained. He is my
master; I had no right to leave him. Oh! I wish
I had not come!"</p>

<p class="i1">Thus she reasoned. Her soul was not yet wholly
given to God. Further trials await her. Breathlessly
she waited for what might happen; the creak of a
door made her heart beat; every footstep made her
tremble.</p>

<p class="i1">At the end of some hours the door opened and
the Prince de Condé was announced.</p>

<p class="i1">"What, alone! Once he would have come himself,"
she murmured.</p>

<p class="i1">Composing herself as best she could, she rose to
meet him. The Prince placed in her hands a letter
from the King; he desired her to return immediately
to Versailles with the bearer.</p>

<p class="i1">La Vallière meekly bowed her head and obeyed.</p>

<p class="i1">No sooner had La Vallière returned to the Hôtel
Biron than the King arrived. He was ruddy with
health; his eyes flashed with the vigour of manhood.
His bearing was proud, yet dignified. On his head
was a hat trimmed with point lace and jewels, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
which hung a fringe of white ostrich feathers, which
mixing with the dark curls of his peruke, covered
his shoulders.</p>

<p class="i1">"Let us live our old life again," said he, uncovering,
and taking her hands in his. "I hate explanations.
Believe me, your presence here, <i>under all
circumstances</i>," and he accentuated these words, "is
necessary to my happiness."</p>

<p class="i1">"But, Sire, Madame de Montespan?"</p>

<p class="i1">Louis became crimson; a momentary frown knit
his dark eyebrows.</p>

<p class="i1">"I desire you to receive her as heretofore," he
replied hurriedly. "Louise, it is a sacrifice you must
make for my sake. You will not refuse. It will
endear you to me more than ever."</p>

<p class="i1">As he spoke he looked at her tenderly.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, I cannot," she replied firmly, casting her
eyes on the ground.</p>

<p class="i1">"How! You dare to refuse me? Louise, I command
you." The King drew himself up; he laid his
hand heavily on her shoulder. Then, seeing how
wasted and frail she was, and how her slight form
quivered under his touch, he added in a softened
tone, "Louise, I entreat you."</p>

<p class="i1">A deep blush suffused her cheeks. Some moments
passed before she could command her voice. "Sire,"
she replied at last, and her white lips trembled,
"Sire, I can never again live the old life,—but I will
obey you."</p>

<p class="i1">The King was about to rush forward to embrace
her. She stopped him by a gesture gentle yet determined.
He fell back.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, you love another. Hitherto I have quieted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
my conscience by the conviction that I was needful
to you. Now I know it is not so. Take back these
tablets, Sire. Can you deny these verses, written by
your own hand but a few days since?"</p>

<p class="i1">Louis stood before her, silenced, confounded.
Her composure astonished him. Before him was La
Vallière—hitherto his slave, now so determined! Her
hand rested on a table for support. She was deadly
pale, and carefully avoided his gaze. He was deeply
moved.</p>

<p class="i1">"Do I not offer you enough?" said he.</p>

<p class="i1">"No, Louis, it is not enough. I will obey you;
I will receive Madame de——" Her voice dropped,
and the hated name was inaudible. "Nay, I will do
more; I will again appear at Court if you command
it, but all hope, all joy, is dead within me."</p>

<p class="i1">She uttered these words deliberately. It was despair
that gave her courage.</p>

<p class="i1">Then she raised her eyes, and rested them for the
first time on him, with an agonised expression. "I
must have your undivided love as heretofore, or——"
and she paused. "I know that my words are sinful,"
she added. "I have fled from you; now I am returned
for a little space."</p>

<p class="i1">Louis looked perplexed. "But, Louise, believe
me, that you are still inexpressibly dear to me; my
heart has wandered, it is true, but you yet possess
my affection, my esteem."</p>

<p class="i1">"It is not enough," repeated La Vallière in a
low voice, "it is not enough. You are turned
from me, you have joined in deceiving me; I am
supplanted."</p>

<p class="i1">The tears sprang involuntarily into the King's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
eyes as he stood with folded arms contemplating her.
He did not dare approach her. How strange it
seemed that one so meek and gentle could be so firm.
Never before had her lips uttered anything to him
but words of tenderness.</p>

<p class="i1">Once more she spoke.</p>

<p class="i1">"As long as you desire it, Sire, I will remain. It
is a penance I shall offer up to God, to remain and
to see you love another." She turned her large grey
eyes up to heaven as she spoke. "When you give
me permission, I shall become a Carmelite."</p>

<p class="i1">"I will never permit it!" cried Louis, stamping
his foot upon the floor. A scowl passed over his
face; he was angry, offended, at her obstinacy; his
imperious will could not brook contradiction. "You
have never loved me!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire!" cried La Vallière. "Not loved you!"</p>

<p class="i1">"No; you have always preferred your religious
scruples to me. You have tormented me with your
remorse. You know nothing of the intoxication of
passion. <i>You</i> ought to have gloried in my love, as
others do," he muttered, in a low voice, turning from
her.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire," cried La Vallière, stung to the quick by
his injustice, "I am at this moment forcing my conscience
to obey you and to remain."</p>

<p class="i1">"You are too weak, too feeble, for a great passion,"
continued the King hurriedly. "Others can
feel it, however."</p>

<p class="i1">"I have never sold myself for ambition, Sire, as
others do. I have never desired anything of you
but yourself, and I have lost you."</p>

<p class="i1">Louis, crimson with passion, did not reply. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
strode up and down the room in moody silence. La
Vallière for a time was also silent. Her eyes followed
him. His face was hard, and no glance told her that
he even pitied her. It was too much. The strain
upon her gentle nature gave way. The pent-up tears
rushed to her eyes, she burst into heart-rending sobs
and sank upon a seat. The King watched her, but
he spoke not a word. His look was stern and set.
For a while her tears flowed fast, and her bosom
heaved wildly. Then she rose to her feet, and approached
him. "All is over!" she said, in a voice
almost inarticulate with sobs. "Never—never—will
I trouble your Majesty more. Your will shall be
now as ever my law. Eternal silence shall cover my
justly merited sufferings. I have nothing more to
say. Permit me to retire." She turned and left the
room; her heart was broken.</p>

<p class="i1">Bossuet was her director. To him she applied for
counsel. She told him that her very soul yearned
for a convent. Bossuet questioned her,—her passionate
remorse, her penitence, her courage, her
resignation touched him deeply. She seemed to be
purified from all earthly stain. Bossuet advised her
to take six months to consider her vocation, during
which time she was to speak to no one of her project.
La Vallière bowed her head and obeyed. At the
termination of the time, she publicly declared her
intention of becoming a Carmelite. The King received
this announcement with some show of feeling.
He sent Lauzun to her, and offered to make her abbess
of the richest convent in France. He entreated
her not to expose her feeble health to the austerities
of so severe an order. La Vallière replied that her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
resolution was unalterable. Before leaving the Hôtel
Biron she asked for a private audience of the Queen.
It was granted. With a veil over her face, and
dressed in the dark robes of the order which she was
about to enter, a hempen cord around her waist, to
which hung a rosary and cross, she entered the
Queen's private apartments at Versailles. Maria
Theresa was alone. La Vallière raised her veil, her
face was moist with tears, she tottered forward with
difficulty and sank upon her knees.</p>

<p class="i1">"My royal mistress," said she, in a faint voice, "I
come to crave your pardon. Oh, Madame, do not,
I implore you, repulse me. Alas! if I have sinned
I have suffered. Suffered—oh, so bitterly, so long!
In a few hours I shall be forgotten within a convent."</p>

<p class="i1">The Queen, a woman of the most kindly and
womanly feelings, was deeply affected.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, Madame la Duchesse," said she, "I have
learnt to know how much I owe you. My life was
much happier when you were at Court. I beg you
to believe I shall be glad to have you again about my
person."</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Majesty honours me beyond expression,"
answered La Vallière, curtseying to the earth.</p>

<p class="i1">"Does the King know of your departure, Madame
la Duchesse?"</p>

<p class="i1">"He will know it after I have acquainted your
Majesty."</p>

<p class="i1">"Surely he will not consent?" asked the Queen.</p>

<p class="i1">La Vallière shook her head—"My mind is made
up, Madame. If I live for one year, I shall be a professed
Carmelite."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"I am sorry," replied Maria Theresa simply, "very
sorry. If my good wishes can serve you, Madame la
Duchesse, you have them most sincerely. Should you,
however, carry out your intention, allow me to present
you with the black veil. It is a public mark of
respect I would willingly pay you."</p>

<p class="i1">La Vallière was so overcome she could not at once
reply, then kissing the Queen's hand which she held
out to her, she said: "Your Majesty's goodness makes
me hope that, as you have deigned to pardon me, I
may still, by a life of penitence, reconcile myself with
God. I most humbly thank you."</p>

<p class="i1">This interview over, she returned to Versailles.
She distributed her possessions as though she were
already dead. She assembled her servants in her
oratory, and earnestly craved their forgiveness for all
that she had said or done amiss. She exhorted them
to be devout, to keep the fasts of the Church, and to
serve God. She was thus occupied until past midnight.
Towards morning she called her coach, and
bid her people drive her quickly towards Chaillot.
As she passed along she gazed eagerly on the blooming
country for the last time. It was the month of
June. The orchards were laden with the promise of
coming fruit; the newly mown grass, sparkling with
morning dew, made the meadows glisten, the birds
carolled in the hedge-rows, and the hills, embowered
in forest, rose green against the azure sky. Louise
was still young; it was her last look on that world
which had once been so pleasant to her.</p>

<p class="i1">At six o'clock in the morning she arrived at the
convent. The Superior, accompanied by all the nuns,
apprised of her arrival, was in waiting to receive her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"My mother," said La Vallière, kneeling at her
feet, "I have used my liberty so ill, that I am come
to give it up into your hands."</p>

<p class="i1">Her long and beautiful hair was cut off before she
entered the convent as a novice. A year afterwards
she made her profession. The Queen and the whole
Court were present—all save the King and Madame
de Montespan. Bossuet preached his celebrated sermon.
Then the Queen Maria Theresa descended
from the tribune, where she had been seated in company
with <i>La Grande Mademoiselle</i>, and invested her
with the black veil. She kissed her tenderly on the
forehead as she did so.</p>

<p class="i1">La Vallière, now Sister Louise de la Miséricorde,
made an exemplary nun. She wore horse-hair next
her skin, walked barefoot along the stone pavement
of the convent, and fasted rigorously. She died at
sixty-six, wasted to a skeleton by her austerities.
Her end was peace.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the line of rail to Orleans, two and a half
leagues from Paris, is the station and village
of Choisy le Roi. Of the enchanting abode once
erected here, on the verge of grassy lawns bordering
the Seine, nothing has been left by the revolution
but a fragment of wall, built into a porcelain manufactory.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Choisy Mademoiselle</i>, afterwards to be called by
Louis XV. <i>Choisy le Roi</i>, was built by Mademoiselle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
de Montpensier, daughter of Gaston, Duc d'Orléans,
under the advice of Le Nôtre. It was to serve as a
summer retreat from the gloomy splendours of the
Luxembourg; a <i>folie</i> where she might spend the
summer heats, try her English horses, train her
hounds, row on the river, tend her aviaries, and
watch her flowers. Here, freed from all scrutiny, she
could be imperious or devout, childish or solemn,
vain or humble, as suited her fickle humour; here
she could set traps to catch obstinate emperors who
refused to wed, fast upon the most delicate morsels,
<i>bouder</i> the Court when neglected by her Jupiter-cousin
the King, and cultivate such remains of beauty
as still lingered on her oval face and almond-shaped
blue eyes.</p>

<p class="i1">At Choisy all was formal, to suit the taste of its
mistress. The <i>corps de logis</i>, a pavilion in one story,
a mass of lofty windows, was flanked on either side
by conservatories and orangeries which masked the
offices. Within, the entire south front was occupied
by a gallery, with frescoed ceiling and cornice; the
walls covered with crimson satin, on which hung the
family portraits of <i>La Grande Mademoiselle</i>. Each
name was written under each portrait, so that all
persons looking on them might read the lofty lineage
of this granddaughter of Henry the Great. At one
extremity of the gallery was a chapel, at the other a
writing-cabinet. Here, the victories and conquests of
Louis XIV., painted in miniature, by Van der Meulen,
were arranged. These miniatures also were
inscribed with names and dates. A likeness of his
Majesty on horseback, when a youth, hung over the
chimney-piece. Beyond the writing-cabinet was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
billiard-room, as well as a suite of private apartments
devoted to the use of the Princess herself. Without,
broad terraces were balanced by flights of steps,
statues, vases, and trophies; <i>jets d'eau</i> rose out of
marble basins, and precisely arranged flowers and
orange-trees adorned the walks. There was a park
of a hundred acres, with woods on either hand,
trimmed to an exact resemblance of each other.
Choisy, like its mistress, was in perpetual <i>costume de
Cour</i>; nothing but the river, towards which the gardens
sloped, was as nature had made it. Not even
<i>La Grande Mademoiselle</i> could prevent the soft summer
breezes from rippling its silvery current, the sun
from playing vagrant pranks upon its wavelets, or
the water-lilies from growing in wild profusion under
the shadow of its tree-shrouded bays.</p>

<p class="i1">Besides Choisy, Mademoiselle possessed the Palace
of the Luxembourg, before-mentioned, the Castles of
Eu, D'Aumale, De Thiers, Dombes, Chatellerault,
and Saint-Fargeau, each surrounded by such vast
estates, that no one except the well-known <i>Marquis
de Carrabas</i> ever had the like.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle, although firmly convinced that the
world was, in great measure, created for her particular
enjoyment, was wonderfully exercised in her mind
at the difficulty she experienced in securing that
much-coveted game (for which she had hunted all
her life), an emperor, or even a king. She, however,
appeased her wounded vanity by the conviction that
she must be considered too masculine in understanding
to consort with any living sovereign. Whatever
happened, this royal lady never by any possibility
could blame herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">About this time, a Gascon gentleman of the Caumont
family, whose name has been already casually
mentioned, began to make much noise at Court.
He was Captain of the Royal Guards, whose service
was the special care of his Majesty's person, and
Field-Marshal, also Governor of Berry. Loaded
with honours, he had dropped the undistinguished
patronymic of Peguillem altogether, and was known
as the Comte de Lauzun. The King, whose understanding
was, as a matter of course, superior to every
one, had said when he was first presented to him at
the Comtesse de Soissons's, that "Lauzun possessed
more wit and penetration than any man in France."
This opinion was accepted as law. That Lauzun
was, by reason of his Gascon blood, cunning, heartless,
and mercenary, as well as audacious, insinuating,
and brave, is only saying that he was what all Gascons
(going up to Court to make their fortunes) were. But
that he was above the ordinary hungry adventurer,
the sequel will show. Holding Court trumps in his
hand, he knew how to play them well. He was a
little man, slight and well formed, with a dull, fair
complexion, reddish hair, keen penetrating grey eyes,
and a most insolent bearing. No one could call him
handsome, no one could deny that he could be
morose, vindictive, and cruel. He spoke sharp, hard
words, affected a certain soldierly swagger, and was
capable of being alike cringing and impertinent.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle was no longer young. The unsuccessful
chase after an emperor had occupied a large
portion of her life. She lived at Court, and was
necessarily thrown much into the company of Lauzun,
who affected an indifference towards her, a rough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and ready manner that piqued her vanity. So she
came gradually (no crowned head appearing in the
matrimonial horizon, only relays of dukes and
insignificant princes) to find Lauzun fascinating and
original. The pleasures of Court palled upon her;
she became pensive, even sentimental, and often
retired to bowery Choisy to meditate on the chances
and changes of life.</p>

<p class="i1">Finally she came to the conclusion that marriage
alone would restore her spirits. But marriage without
an emperor? It was a great come-down, certainly.
Yet there are no laws but the laws of passion
in the kingdom of love. Mademoiselle reasoned
that her sublimity was so exalted she could raise any
man to her own level. In a word, she discovered
that all earthly bliss depended on her marriage with
Monsieur de Lauzun.</p>

<p class="i1">Now Mademoiselle was, as we have seen, a very
determined, even masculine, lady. She had pointed
the guns of the Bastille against her cousin the King;
she had all but led an army into the battlefield.
Having come to a determination, she proceeded incontinently
to carry it out. But she encountered
uncontemplated difficulties. The crafty Lauzun,
who read her like a book, became suddenly respectful
and silent. As she approached, he receded.
Mademoiselle was extremely embarrassed, and more
violently in love than ever. This was precisely what
Lauzun intended.</p>

<p class="i1">We are in the Queen's apartments at the Louvre,
within a stately retiring-room. The walls are covered
with white brocade, on which is a gold pattern.
They are panelled by gilt scroll-work. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
carved ceiling, which is supported by pilasters, is
painted Apollo ushering in the day. The furniture
is of green damask; colossal chandeliers of crystal
and gilt bronze are reflected in mirrors placed at
either end. Over the mantelpiece, which is carved
and richly gilt, hangs a portrait of the King.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle, attended by her lady of honour,
enters about the time of the Queen's lever. She
finds Lauzun in a corner talking with the Comtesse
de Guiche. He takes no notice of her, though she
gives a slight cough to attract his attention. She
does not like it. Besides not saluting her, which he
ought to have done, he seems quite to have thrown
off his usual <i>insouciance</i>, and to find the conversation
of the Comtesse de Guiche much too interesting.
Mademoiselle retires into the recess of a window,
and watches him.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun continues talking with unaccustomed
eagerness. He still takes no notice whatever of Mademoiselle;
her royal highness has therefore to wait—yes,
actually to wait; a thing she has never done
in her life before to an inferior—until he has done
talking.</p>

<p class="i1">But when he does approach her, he advances with
such a noble air, he is in her eyes so handsome, that
"To me," she says in her memoirs, "he seemed the
very master of the world." Not only does she forgive
him, but her whole heart goes out to meet him,
and her pulses throb violently—so violently, indeed,
she is obliged to wait for a moment ere she can
address him.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun makes her a ceremonious bow, places his
hand on his embroidered waistcoat and point-lace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<i>jabot</i>, at the place where, if he had one, his heart
would have been, casts down his eyes, and awaits
her pleasure.</p>

<p class="i1">Now, it must be specially borne in mind that Mademoiselle,
much against her will, may be now
called "<i>an old maid</i>," which condition may reasonably
excuse her ardour.</p>

<p class="i1">"I flatter myself, Count," she says—blushing at
her own backwardness, yet infinitely gratified at the
same time by Lauzun's attitude of respectful attention—"I
flatter myself you take some interest in me."
She looks up, expecting some outburst of protestation
at the studied humility of her language. Lauzun,
his hand still resting somewhere in the region of
where his heart ought to be, bows again, but does
not reply. "You are a faithful friend, I know, Monsieur
de Lauzun," continues Mademoiselle, confused
at his perfect composure, and evolving in her own
mind the impossibility of saying all that she desires
if he continues silent. "You are, too, a man of the
world—" she hesitates. Still Lauzun is mute.
"Even his Majesty has the highest respect for your
judgment." Again she pauses, flushes crimson, not
only on her cheeks, but over her well-formed neck
and snowy shoulders. Lauzun makes a slight inclination,
but otherwise maintains the same attitude.
Mademoiselle's voice, ordinarily rather shrill and
loud, is low and persuasive. She looks at him inquiringly,
and stretches out both her hands as if to
claim his special attention to what she is about to
say. Lauzun appears not to observe her anxiety, and
fixes his eyes on the ground. "Will you favour me
with your advice, Monsieur de Lauzun? I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
esteem it a great kindness." Her tone is almost one
of supplication.</p>

<p class="i1">"I am deeply sensible of the honour your highness
does me," replies Lauzun, disengaging his hand
from his waistcoat, and again bowing, this time very
stiffly. "On what subject may I venture to advise
your royal highness?"</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle is conscious she has something very
extraordinary to say. She hoped that, seeing her
evident perplexity, Lauzun would have helped her.
Not a bit. She must trust entirely to herself. Her
pride comes to her help. She remembers who she
is, draws herself up, steadies her voice, and takes a
few steps nearer to where he is standing.</p>

<p class="i1">"It is a very delicate subject, Monsieur de Lauzun;
nothing but my confidence in your honour and
your discretion would otherwise induce me to broach
it. But——" and she falters.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun does not stir, only with the slightest
perceptible motion he raises his eyebrows, which
Mademoiselle perceives, and, fearing that he is
impatient, speaks quickly.</p>

<p class="i1">"Do you know—can you tell me——" here she
pauses; then observing that he makes a hasty gesture,
she forces herself to proceed—"you, Monsieur
de Lauzun, who are the confidant of the King, can
you tell me whom he purposes me to marry?"</p>

<p class="i1">Having said thus much she is so overcome she
would like to sink into a chair. There is none at
hand; besides, she dare not leave Lauzun, so eager
is she for his reply.</p>

<p class="i1">He raises his head and fixes his deep-set eyes
upon her with a bold, cold gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"I assure you, madame, I am absolutely ignorant
of his Majesty's pleasure in this matter. I am
persuaded, however, from what I know of the
elevation of his sentiments on all subjects, that he
would desire you solely to follow your own inclination."
A malicious twinkle comes into his eye, and
he smiles almost as it seems in mockery.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle becomes more and more discomposed.
Never had an interview been so difficult to
manage. "Surely," she thinks, "Lauzun is not
laughing at me!" Yet she is too much in love to
drop a conversation which she is determined shall
lead to an explanation of his feelings towards
herself. All this Lauzun is aware of; he rejoices in
intensifying her perplexity.</p>

<p class="i1">"Monsieur de Lauzun," she says timidly, playing
with one of the soft curls that falls upon her neck,
"I hoped you could have told me. I earnestly
desire your acquiescence in the choice I am about
to make. You must necessarily be interested in it."</p>

<p class="i1">An appealing look comes into her face; but she
tries in vain to catch Lauzun's eye. "At my age,"
and she sighs profoundly, "persons rarely marry
contrary to their inclinations. Every crowned head
in Europe has solicited my hand. Until lately,
however, my heart was free." She sighs again, and
gazes imploringly at him. He must understand her,
she tells herself, but as his looks are bent on the
ground she cannot tell. Lauzun inclines his head,
and seems to await her further communications.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have seen no one to please me until lately,"
she goes on to say; "I love my country, Monsieur
de Lauzun; I think I could only be happy with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
countryman—one"—(something rises in her throat,
and stops her utterance; she clears her voice)—"one
whom I know well—whom I esteem—whose person
and manners are agreeable to me; one with a high
place at Court, and who possesses the esteem of my
cousin, the King." All this is spoken significantly
and with marked emphasis.</p>

<p class="i1">A delicious glow runs through her frame. Breathlessly
she awaits his reply.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your highness speaks with admirable sense,"
answers Lauzun with great deliberation. "How
many illustrious persons about the Court would be
honoured by knowing your gracious sentiments.
Permit me, madame, to make them public."</p>

<p class="i1">"Not for the world, Monsieur de Lauzun," exclaims
Mademoiselle hurriedly. "I am speaking to
you strictly in confidence." Her countenance has
fallen, and she has turned very white. Lauzun
watches her under his eyelids, and enjoys her
sufferings.</p>

<p class="i1">"Why should one so happy as your highness
marry at all?" he adds, seeing that she does not
speak.</p>

<p class="i1">"I am happy, certainly, if riches and royal birth
can confer happiness," she replies thoughtfully;
"but there are drawbacks, Monsieur de Lauzun. I
wish to confer my wealth upon a worthy individual."</p>

<p class="i1">("Myself, for instance," says Lauzun to himself;
"I shall be delighted to spend it; indeed, I intend
to do so.")</p>

<p class="i1">"Many people," continues Mademoiselle, "at this
very moment wish me dead in order to inherit it,"
and a sigh escapes her. "I am very lonely, Monsieur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
de Lauzun, very lonely." Her face assumes a
melting expression, such as he had never seen on it
before. What could she say to make him understand
her? Thinking of this she sighs again very
audibly. Lauzun knits his brows and affects to be
lost in thought.</p>

<p class="i1">"That is a most serious consideration, your highness.
I admit it had not before occurred to me.
Permit me time to consider of it before I tender any
further advice."</p>

<p class="i1">A thousand hopes rush into Mademoiselle's mind.
"He understands me," she tells herself, "but my
exalted position alarms him. He will propose to
me when next we meet."</p>

<p class="i1">At this moment the Queen entered the withdrawing-room.</p>

    alt="Drop Cap T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE following evening at her Majesty's circle
Lauzun approaches Mademoiselle. A smile is
on his face, and his manner is less formal. Mademoiselle
seats herself apart in a recess, and signs to
him to place himself beside her. "Now, now, he
will speak," she repeats to herself.</p>

<p class="i1">"Are you prepared, M. de Lauzun, to give me
your opinion on my approaching marriage?" The
tone of her voice is low and sweet; her hand falls
near his; he draws a little back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Believe me, madame, each word you have uttered
is graven on my heart. I have founded many
<i>châteaux d'Espagne</i> on them."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle is enchanted. "This is the moment,"
thinks she. She grows hot and cold by
turns, and with difficulty conceals her delight.</p>

<p class="i1">"Pray speak to me with frankness, Count. I
want to discuss with you the most important event
of my life—my marriage."</p>

<p class="i1">"I am deeply gratified at being appointed president
of your council, madame." Lauzun's manner
suddenly changes. He is all at once disagreeable,
stiff, and supercilious. He settles his ruffles over
his hands, and pulls at his moustache. "Allow me
to say, however, that no one in the world could
enter into this delicate matter with more profound
respect for you than myself."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle is strangely baffled; spite of herself
the conversation is drifting away, she knows not
whither. She cannot decide if Lauzun is gratified
or offended at her advances—a strange dilemma for
a love-sick princess worth many millions!</p>

<p class="i1">"Pray, Count, let us resume our discussion of
your own opinion on the matter in question. Do
you advise me to marry?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Your merit, madame, is so great, I know no one
worthy of you." He speaks with the utmost indifference.
"Why resign your present brilliant position?"
he adds.</p>

<p class="i1">"Is he mocking me?" she thinks, "or is he
bashful?" As this doubt presents itself, Mademoiselle's
heart sinks within her. "What can I say to
make him understand me?" she murmurs. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
she next speaks a slight asperity is apparent in her
tone. She is not used to be trifled with; she cannot
brook it even from Lauzun. She rises impatiently.</p>

<p class="i1">"I beg you will remember, Monsieur de Lauzun,
that I consider no sacrifice too great to ensure me
the husband I have described to you."</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun feels that he may go too far; he instantly
assumes a look of intense humility.</p>

<p class="i1">"Such a man as you describe, madame, ought to
esteem himself supremely blest. He should love
you more than life!" He speaks with enthusiasm.
Mademoiselle thrills with rapture; her cheeks mantle
with blushes. "At last the moment is come," she
thinks. She reseats herself and turns, with breathless
impatience, towards Lauzun, who meets her ardent
gaze. Lauzun instantly checks himself; the cold
look is again on his face.</p>

<p class="i1">"Where will you find such a man?" he says.
"Will your highness permit me to search for one?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Monsieur de Lauzun, if you are in earnest you
need not search long," she replies significantly.
Could she then have caught his eye, all would have
been told.</p>

<p class="i1">"Pray inform me on whom your choice has fallen,
madame? We may both have fixed on the same
person."</p>

<p class="i1">Had she dared she would have openly named
himself, but he is suddenly grown so cold and
distant, she is utterly discomfited. Lauzun crosses
his arms on his breast and falls into a muse.</p>

<p class="i1">"Have you ever, madame, contemplated the
advantages of being a nun?" he asks abruptly.
"Devotion is often the refuge of single women."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle is aghast. Her hands drop helplessly
to her side, her head sinks on her bosom.</p>

<p class="i1">"Good heavens!" she thinks, "what evil fortune
pursues me? Will no man ever understand I love
him?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Upon the whole, madame, I advise you to remain
as you are." Lauzun's voice is harsh, his sallow
face is flushed. He is conscious of the difficulty
of his position, with an ardent princess beside him,
whose passion must be irritated to the utmost in
order to induce her to overleap all obstacles. "It is
too soon to yield," he thinks.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have the honour to tell you, Monsieur de
Lauzun, I have selected marriage," rejoins Mademoiselle
haughtily. She is fast losing her temper.
Lauzun instantly assumes a deeply penitent air.</p>

<p class="i1">"For myself," he says meekly, "my only pleasure
is in the service of his Majesty. I am fit for nothing
else." As he speaks his dejected look sends a pang
to her heart. "If I leave his Majesty, it will be——"
he stops, Mademoiselle listens breathlessly—"it will
be to enter a monastery. Nothing but my attachment
to my royal master restrains me."</p>

<p class="i1">"Blessed Virgin!" ejaculates Mademoiselle, clasping
her hands. "Who could have believed it?"</p>

<p class="i1">"I shall never marry," continues Lauzun. He
hangs down his head, apparently overcome with
despondency.</p>

<p class="i1">"How?—Why?" demands Mademoiselle eagerly.
"For what reason?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Marriage has often been proposed to me, your
highness, but there are insurmountable difficulties."</p>

<p class="i1">"Name them, I entreat you," she cries imperiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"My wife, madame, must be a paragon of virtue,
or I should murder her. I dread the morals of the
Court. Not the wealth of the Indies would tempt
me to marry and to doubt. I would not unite myself
to a princess of the blood, under such conditions."</p>

<p class="i1">"Noble heart!" exclaims Mademoiselle aside.
"You can very easily find the virtuous lady you
seek," she adds aloud, in a voice tremulous with
suppressed passion. She turns towards Lauzun, and
for a moment touches his hand which lies close to
her own. "My choice is made," she adds resolutely.
"I shall announce it to his Majesty to-morrow."</p>

<p class="i1">"For heaven's sake, forbear!" exclaims Lauzun,
with real earnestness, starting to his feet; "you
make me tremble. You must say nothing. It concerns
my honour, madame," and he smote upon his
breast. Mademoiselle turns her glowing eyes upon
him. "My honour as your adviser, madame, I
mean," adds Lauzun, correcting himself and speaking
in an altered tone. But all his self-command
could not wholly conceal the triumph he felt at having
so successfully acted his part. "As your adviser,
madame, I forbid you to speak to the King. The
time is not yet come. (I hold her," he says to
himself, "she is mine!")</p>

<p class="i1">At this moment a page enters and desires him to
join his Majesty, who is walking up and down in the
quadrangle with some gentlemen. Mademoiselle is
as much at a loss as ever to make Lauzun understand
her. Just as a crisis approaches, they are
always interrupted. She longs to ask him why she
should not tell the King? Once or twice she tried
to do so, but Lauzun invariably turned the conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
into such a channel as effectually silenced
Mademoiselle, who spite of her pride was easily
abashed.</p>

<p class="i1">At last she hits upon an expedient.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have the name of my intended written on this
slip of paper, Monsieur de Lauzun," she says, and
she offers him a sealed note at their next meeting.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun draws back, stares at her, and frowns. "I
do not wish to take the note, madame. I feel that
it forebodes me misfortune, my heart beats so violently."
Still he stretches out his hand and takes
the paper which she offers.</p>

<p class="i1">This takes place in the morning, at the Queen's
lever. Maria Theresa is on her way to mass, accompanied
by Mademoiselle, who is in a state of indescribable
perturbation. She had seen Lauzun open
the note, and read the paper, on which is written the
magic words, "<i>It is you</i>."</p>

<p class="i1">This great princess, arrived at a mature age, and
as proud as Lucifer, trembles like a leaf during mass,
and requires all the restraints of etiquette to hide the
tumult of her feelings. After mass the Queen goes
to visit the Dauphin, who is ailing. Mademoiselle
awaits her return in a gallery outside. Lauzun is
there. He leans against the chimney-piece, lost in
thought. A bright fire of logs is burning on the
hearth. His countenance betrays nothing. He
neither seeks nor avoids her. Mademoiselle rubs her
hands, advances to the fire and shivers.</p>

<p class="i1">"I am paralysed with cold," she says, in a soft
voice. She bends over the fire. Lauzun bows and
retires some steps to make room for her.</p>

<p class="i1">"I am more paralysed than your highness," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
says stiffly, looking round to see that no one is near.
His face is inscrutable. "I have read the note you
did me the honour to place in my hands. I am not,
however, so foolish as to fall into such a snare; your
highness is amusing yourself at my expense. You
conceal the real name of your intended husband
and substitute mine. You do this to mortify me.
You are very cruel." He gives her a stealthy look.
Mademoiselle staggers backward; she supports herself
against a chair. She does not know whether to
laugh or cry. Then feeling that the moment so
longed for is come, she collects herself and speaks
with dignity.</p>

<p class="i1">"I assure you, Monsieur de Lauzun, the name
you have read on that paper, is the name of the
man I mean to marry."</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun shakes his head incredulously.</p>

<p class="i1">"Not only so, Monsieur de Lauzun, but I intend
immediately informing the King of my intention,
unless," adds she, in a tender voice, "you forbid
me." She would have liked to have gathered into
one glance all the love she felt for him. To have
told him her passionate admiration for his person,
her respect for his magnanimity in rejecting the
splendid position she offered him. She would have
liked to do this; but, in the face of such exalted independence,
her womanly delicacy takes alarm. She
can neither look at him nor utter a single word.</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame," says Lauzun at length, addressing
her with the utmost solemnity, "you have ill recompensed
the zeal I have shown for you. Henceforth,
I can approach you no more. Great as is my
respect for your highness, I cannot permit myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
to be exposed to ridicule. You are, madame, making
me the butt of the whole Court."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle starts violently, then she places her
hand upon his arm. "Lauzun," she says, and her
voice sinks into a tone of the humblest entreaty, "I
beseech you to understand me. My resolution may
seem hasty, but your great qualities excuse it. I
have made up my mind. I shall ask his Majesty's
permission to marry you."</p>

<p class="i1">At last she has spoken! The woman has overcome
the princess. Lauzun stands before her with
downcast eyes—a victim, as it seems, to his own
perfection. The time was now come that he must
coquet no more. Placing his hand on his heart, he
made her a deep obeisance.</p>

<p class="i1">"But, madame, I am only a Gascon gentleman.
None but a sovereign is a fit consort for your
highness."</p>

<p class="i1">"I will make you a prince, Count," rejoins she,
with a tender look. "I will create you Duc de
Montpensier. I have wealth and dignities; both
are yours."</p>

<p class="i1">Her eyes sparkle, her cheeks burn. An air of
mingled power, pride, love, and exultation overspreads
her face. Her tall figure is raised to its full
height: she clasps the hand of Lauzun; he raises it
to his lips.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your highness overwhelms me," he whispers,
with genuine feeling. For an instant, Lauzun—the
cold, heartless Lauzun—felt her influence. Could
he really love this exalted lady, who had thus honoured
him? He looks fixedly into her face, now
transfigured by the deep passions that stirred her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
inmost soul. Could he love her? He, a penniless
cadet, of an insignificant name? Etiquette set at
defiance, a princess at his feet, enormous wealth, a
royal dukedom in his grasp! Could he love her?—For
a moment a rush of wild thoughts whirl
through his brain. She worships him. He could
make her life a long enchantment. He was about
to kneel to her, to thank her, even to press her in
his arms. But he stops and steadies himself. No—she
is too old; wrinkles gather about her mouth,
her fair hair is partly grey, the bloom has long faded
from her cheeks, the fire of youth from her eye.
What is she but an old maid, inflamed by a furious
passion for a man greatly younger than herself?
Should he, the brilliant Lauzun, burn incense on
the altar of such an idol? Impossible. He would
be the laughing-stock of the Court! His lively
imagination grasps the whole situation in an instant.
Lauzun's baser nature conquered. The momentary
warmth fades out of his heart for ever.
He heaves a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class="i1">"Monsieur de Lauzun," says Mademoiselle, far
too much occupied with her own raptures to heed
or to understand what was passing in his mind,
"you sigh. Fear nothing; I will obtain his Majesty's
permission for our speedy marriage."</p>

<p class="i1">Would Louis XIV. consent to the marriage of his
cousin-german with a simple gentleman? Would
Madame de Montespan, with whom Lauzun had intrigued,
fall into this arrangement, or would she use
her all-powerful influence against it? These are
awful questions. Lauzun's blood ran cold when he
thought of it. Madame de Montespan is treacherous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and as vindictive and clever as himself. Louvois,
too, the minister, is his enemy.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle, however, ignorant of these dangers,
acted without a moment's hesitation. She wrote a
long letter to the King, announcing her choice, and
asking for his consent. Lauzun saw and approved
the letter. It was then confided to Bontemps, who
carried it to his Majesty.</p>

<p class="i1">Louis did not vouchsafe an immediate answer.
He sent word to his cousin that she had better reflect
well upon what she was about to do. But the countenance
of the royal Jupiter beamed upon his favourite
Lauzun with undiminished warmth, and he
was most affectionate to his cousin. Both naturally
drew favourable augeries. Mademoiselle was now
steeped in the sweets of an acknowledged passion.
Lauzun condescended to be gracious, spite of some
little eccentricities such as not always approaching
her, or even replying to her when she addressed him—eccentricities
attributed by her to his great modesty
and discretion. Still, the King had not given
his consent.</p>

<p class="i1">One evening his Majesty played late at <i>écarté</i>, so
late indeed that it was two o'clock, and he was still
at the table. Mademoiselle sat nodding on a brocaded
fauteuil beside the Queen. She was determined
to see every one out, and to speak to her
royal cousin.</p>

<p class="i1">She longed so much to salute her lover Duc de
Montpensier; to behold him raised to the Olympian
circle that surrounded the family god. She longed
for many things; life had of late become a delightful
mystery to her. Each day unfolded some link
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
in that delicious chain that bound her for ever to her
adored Lauzun!</p>

<p class="i1">At last the Queen rose. As she passed by she
whispered to Mademoiselle—"You must have some
very important business with the King to remain so
late. I can sit up no longer."</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame," she replied, rising, "it is a matter of
life and death to me. If I succeed it will be announced
at the council to-morrow morning."</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, my cousin," said the poor Queen, who
never understood anything that was going on, and
was not intended to do so, "I wish you all success.
Good night."</p>

<p class="i1">By-and-by Louis left off playing. He rose, and
walked up to Mademoiselle. "What, cousin, you
are still here? You did not accompany her Majesty?
Do you know the time? It is two o'clock."</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, I wish to speak a few words to you."</p>

<p class="i1">The King yawned, gave a glance towards the door,
then leant wearily against the wall. "Excuse me
for to-night, cousin," said he; "I am tired."</p>

<p class="i1">"I shall not be long," urged Mademoiselle; "but do
be seated, or I feel I cannot address you properly."</p>

<p class="i1">"No, I am very well thus. Speak, my cousin. I
am all attention."</p>

<p class="i1">This was an awful moment. Mademoiselle's heart
thumped audibly against her side. Her throat became
so parched no words would come.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire," she began, and her voice failed her. The
King watched her; he had seen a good deal of
women by this time, and understood their ways. He
knew she was about to speak to him of Lauzun, and
smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Take time, my cousin," said he graciously; "you
are agitated; take time."</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire," again began poor Mademoiselle—fortunately
her voice now came to her, and she continued—"I
want to tell you that the resolution I had the
honour of submitting to your Majesty respecting
the Comte de Lauzun is unshaken. I shall never be
happy unless I am his wife."</p>

<p class="i1">"Yet, my cousin, you have hitherto been most
severe on those princesses who have married beneath
their rank—your step-sister, Madame de Guise, for
example. Lauzun is certainly the most complete
grand seigneur of my Court; but I still advise you
to reflect well upon the step you are taking. I do
not wish to constrain you."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle clasped her hands; her face beamed.</p>

<p class="i1">"I love and esteem you beyond measure, my cousin,"
added Louis, taking her hands in his. "I
shall rejoice to have you always about my person.
But be careful; Lauzun has many enemies. I do
not forbid you; but remember, a sovereign is often
forced to act against his will. This intended marriage
is now little known; do not give time for all
the world to discuss it. Let me warn you and Lauzun
to be cautious; above all, lose no time, my cousin.
Take my advice, lose no time."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Sire!" exclaimed Mademoiselle in an ecstasy,
"if you are with us, who can be against us?"</p>

<p class="i1">Louis embraced her, and they parted.</p>

<p class="i1">Any one less infatuated than Mademoiselle, less
arrogant than Lauzun, would have understood the
King's friendly caution, "<i>to lose no time</i>." But they
were both too intoxicated with their different feelings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to heed the advice of the really well-meaning
Louis. Lauzun lost his head completely. He accepted,
day after day, the magnificent presents sent
him by Mademoiselle. He ordered fresh equipages,
horses, jewels, and plate. He was created Duc de
Montpensier. He shrank from the amorous ardour
of the doting Princess, but he gloried in her munificence.
Still unmarried, he revelled in it without a
drawback! He was a mean, selfish fellow, Monsieur
de Lauzun, like all men who marry heiresses they do
not care for. The words of warning came again, and
this time to his ear. "<i>Marry while you can</i>," was
said to him. Mademoiselle, still enacting the
masculine part, urged an early day, but she urged in
vain.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ABOUT this time Lauzun, soon to become cousin-german
to the King, solicited the distinguished
post of Grand Master of the Artillery. Already he
commanded the Dragoons, and was captain of the
hundred gentlemen pensioners who guarded the
person of the Sovereign; but this was not enough.
The King readily promised him the appointment;
but time went on, and no warrant came. Lauzun
grew uneasy—specially as each time he recalled the
subject the King evidently evaded it. What did this
mean? Who was his enemy? He spoke to the
favourite, Madame de Montespan, although he was
well aware he had given her good cause for hating
him. Madame de Montespan, with the most winning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
smiles, promised him her assistance. Still no
warrant came. Again Lauzun ventured to recall his
promise to the King at his lever, while handing him
his feathered hat and cane. Louis turned away his
head, addressed the Duc de Roquelaure, and affected
not to hear him. There was treachery somewhere!
Lauzun shrewdly suspected Madame de Montespan.
He would know for certain that very day, and if it
were so he would unmask her. He offered a heavy
bribe to one of her confidential attendants, well
known to him in the days of their <i>liaison</i>, and prevailed
on her to introduce him into the saloon, where
the King would visit Madame de Montespan before
supper, that very afternoon. Louis, who told his
mistress everything, and consulted her about all important
appointments, would be sure to mention
Lauzun's renewed application of that morning. At
all events Lauzun would chance it. He knew the
lady was from home, having seen her start, in company
with the Queen and Mademoiselle de Montpensier,
for a drive to Saint-Cloud. He had handed
his betrothed into the royal coach. No sooner had
they started than Lauzun was admitted into Madame
de Montespan's apartments by her friendly attendant.
She assisted him in his arrangements, and finally
concealed him under a large couch covered with fine
tapestry, on which Madame de Montespan usually
sat. It was an undignified proceeding. He had to
divest himself of his periwig and plumed hat, take
off his richly embroidered satin coat, tuck up his shirt
sleeves, and crouch upon his hands and knees upon
the dusty floor. But these are trifles to a man bent
upon revenge!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Shortly before the hour of supper, which their
Majesties eat in public, Lauzun recognised Madame
de Montespan's voice within her boudoir. Then he
heard steps approaching. He could swear to the
King's solemn tread and the sound of his cane tapping
on the floor.</p>

<p class="i1">Almost before he could settle himself in the best
position for listening the King was announced. At
the same moment Madame de Montespan entered
from her boudoir on the other side of the saloon. He
heard her advance to the door and receive the King.
She kissed his hand; Louis saluted her on both
cheeks, and led her to the couch under which Lauzun
lay concealed.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Majesty looks vexed this afternoon," said
Madame de Montespan in a softly modulated voice.
"What has happened?"</p>

<p class="i1">"I am exceedingly annoyed about that affair of
Lauzun," replied Louis, seating himself in an arm-chair.
"He has again applied to me about the Artillery
this morning."</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Montespan leant back indolently
among the cushions, little dreaming who was crouching
beneath so near her, and placed her feet upon an
embroidered stool. A feather fan hung at her side,
and as the weather was warm she took it up and
moved it languidly to and fro, gazing absently at the
King, who awaited her reply.</p>

<p class="i1">"Did you hear what I said, Athanaise? I am
annoyed about Lauzun."</p>

<p class="i1">"I heard, Sire; but what can I say? You already
know my opinion on that subject. Need I
repeat it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">This was said in a careless manner, as she sank
back deeper among the cushions.</p>

<p class="i1">(Lauzun was all ears. "She has given her opinion
then," he said to himself. "I think I can guess what
it was.")</p>

<p class="i1">"I promised Lauzun the place, remember," continued
the King. "He certainly merits it; but your
friend Louvois will not hear of his appointment. He
torments me every time I see him to give the Artillery
to the Comte de Lude."</p>

<p class="i1">"I certainly advise you," returned the lady, glancing
at herself in an opposite mirror and arranging the
fringe of small curls that lay on her forehead, "to be
guided by the advice of so experienced a minister as
Louvois, rather than listen to such an empty-headed
coxcomb as Lauzun."</p>

<p class="i1">("Ah, that is the opinion you have of me, is it?"
muttered Lauzun. "Now I know you, you traitress!")</p>

<p class="i1">"But remember, Athanaise," said the King, taking
out his snuff-box and applying the powder to his
nose with great deliberation—"remember his attachment
to me, his courage."</p>

<p class="i1">"His attachment to you, Sire!" and Madame de
Montespan smiled ironically. "Do you believe in
it?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Certainly. Then my word——"</p>

<p class="i1">"Bah! your word—that is nothing. Withdraw it."</p>

<p class="i1">("Ah! fiend," exclaimed Lauzun in a low voice,
clenching his fists as well as his position allowed him;
"this is the way you plead my cause, is it? Curses
on you!")</p>

<p class="i1">"You need not fear for Lauzun," continued the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
lady blandly. "Mademoiselle will take care of his
interests—the old fool!"</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Montespan, in imitation of <i>La Grande
Mademoiselle</i>, bridled, simpered, craned her neck,
rounded her elbows, and stared superciliously under
her eyelids. Louis laughed.</p>

<p class="i1">"Spare my poor cousin, Marquise. She is eminently
ridiculous; but I love her sincerely. Her
genuine affection for Lauzun touches me."</p>

<p class="i1">"For my part, Sire, I cannot understand how any
woman can care for him. He is such a <i>petit maître</i>—ill-made,
short, with a complexion like a lemon—altogether
detestable. Not a man to my taste, certainly,"
added she contemptuously, at the same time
casting a flattering glance at the King, as much as to
say, in his presence no other man could possibly be
thought of. The King understood the glance and
the compliment, and smiled upon her.</p>

<p class="i1">"The ladies are not on your side, however," returned
he. "They all adore Lauzun. But about
this command of Artillery—to whom am I to
give it?"</p>

<p class="i1">("Now I shall know all the depths of your
treachery, Athanaise de Montespan!" said Lauzun
half aloud to himself from under the couch.)</p>

<p class="i1">"Did any one speak?" asked the King quickly.
"I thought I heard a voice."</p>

<p class="i1">(Lauzun bit his lips with vexation.)</p>

<p class="i1">"It must be my parrot, Sire," answered Madame
de Montespan. "In giving away so important a
post you ought certainly to consult the welfare of
France. All personal considerations should be sacrificed."
De Montespan spoke pompously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">("<i>Sacré Dieu!</i>" murmured Lauzun. "She is a
female Judas!")</p>

<p class="i1">"What can the welfare of France have to do with
this appointment?" asked the King, smiling.</p>

<p class="i1">("That is what I want to know too," whispered
Lauzun. "Speak, serpent!")</p>

<p class="i1">"No man in France is better adapted to fill this
post than Lauzun," added Louis gravely.</p>

<p class="i1">"How?" cried Madame de Montespan, sitting upright,
and speaking in a shrill voice and with much
animation, as the King seemed to vacillate. "How,
Sire? Can you forget that dissensions between
Louvois offended, and Lauzun imperious, (and you
know, Sire, his overbearing temper, and how
audacious he can be) must be exceedingly prejudicial
to the State?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Spoken like an oracle!" exclaimed the King,
looking admiringly at her. "What a head you have
for business, madame! You are as beautiful as
Venus, and as wise as Minerva!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Majesty flatters me," replied the lady, casting
an enamoured glance at him. "I only observe
what is perfectly plain. I am sure your Majesty's penetration
must have arrived at this conclusion already.
Remember, Louvois may resign, if you affront him,"
continued she, fixing her bright eyes on Louis.</p>

<p class="i1">"Now, all the fates prevent it!" cried Louis with
alarm. "I should be lost without Louvois."</p>

<p class="i1">"Then you must at once refuse Lauzun!" cried
De Montespan with decision.</p>

<p class="i1">("By heaven, I will be revenged!" muttered
Lauzun, stung with sudden rage at her perfidy, in a
louder voice than he was aware of.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Now I am certain I heard some one speak!" exclaimed
the King, frowning, and turning his ear
towards the spot from which the sound came. He
paused to listen. "Athanaise," said he, rising, and
looking suspiciously at Madame de Montespan,
"this is very strange. I demand an explanation." His
Olympian brow was knit.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your Majesty is mistaken, you only heard my
parrot in the anteroom. Surely you do not doubt
me, Sire!" added she in a tearful voice, putting her
handkerchief to her eyes. "Such an insult would
kill me." Her bosom heaved. "Oh, Louis, you
cannot love me if you entertain such unworthy
suspicions." Sobs, real or false, here stifled her
voice.</p>

<p class="i1">Meanwhile Louis rose hastily, and looked into the
corners and behind all the cabinets, as if determined
to make a thorough investigation of the whole room.
This would have rendered Lauzun's position desperate.
He positively shook with terror. Madame de
Montespan still sobbed, her handkerchief pressed to
her eyes.</p>

<p class="i1">The King took a few turns up and down the
saloon, brandished his cane, and moved some chairs.
The noise he made roused the parrot in the next
room into a fury. It screeched so loud that for a
time nothing else could be heard.</p>

<p class="i1">Finding no one, Louis, rather embarrassed, placed
himself at a window. He looked back at the beautiful
woman still weeping on the settee. "Come, no
more tears, Athanaise," he said tenderly, approaching
her with a penitent look and taking the handkerchief
from her face. "Let this kiss seal my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
pardon. But the voice was really so distinct. I
thought for a moment——" Madame de Montespan
fixed her eyes reproachfully on him. "Well, no
matter. Then you advise me to refuse Lauzun the
post he desires?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Certainly," returned the lady with decision. She
was now quite calm and alive to business.</p>

<p class="i1">A knock was heard at the door. Several gentlemen
in waiting, attended by pages, entered and
announced that supper was served and the Queen
already at table.</p>

<p class="i1">"I must leave you, my angel," said the King, in
a low voice, rising. "It is time you should prepare
for the performance of Molière's play in the theatre
arranged for to-night. Adieu, my adored Marquise.
Forgive my want of courtesy," he whispered in her
ear. "But the parrot's voice was so natural.—I will
wipe off my fault in any manner you please."</p>

<p class="i1">"I ask for nothing, Sire," replied she, in the same
low tone, "but that you should refuse this place to
Lauzun. Do this, and you are forgiven," and her
eyes beamed on the King, who, after placing his hat,
covered with a plume of snowy ostrich feathers, on
his head, raised it, bowed to her, and kissed her hand.
Then replacing his hat before he left the room with
his attendants, he passed the outer entrance, where
the <i>gardes du corps</i>, who never left him, presented
arms.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Montespan passed into her closet.</p>

<p class="i1">When the saloon was empty, Lauzun, crimson in
the face, foaming with rage and much rumpled in
appearance, emerged from his hiding-place. He
hastily replaced his wig,—so hastily, indeed, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
put it on awry,—and dragged on his coat with such
violence that he tore off the priceless Malines lace
ruffles. Oath after oath fell from his lips as he
dressed himself. "You shall pay for this, devil of a
Marquise! <i>Morbleu</i>, I will make you wince!" he
muttered—for he dared not speak louder until he
had left the room. This he did, closing the doors
with the utmost precaution behind him.</p>

<p class="i1">The suite of rooms assigned to Madame de Montespan
led by a corridor to the landing of the grand
marble staircase of the south wing. On the other
side and across this landing were the state apartments,
situated in the centre of the palace. To
reach them Madame de Montespan must pass this
corridor. Lauzun placed himself behind the outer
door, and awaited her. After a long time she appeared.
Her hair, just touched with powder, was
sown with diamonds. A necklace of large single
brilliants, linked together with pearls, lay upon her
neck. Her dress was of pink satin, woven with gold;
the low body fitting tightly, displayed to the utmost
advantage her exquisite form. Her train of violet
velvet, bordered by pearls and <i>passementerie</i> of gold,
swept the ground. She was a miracle of loveliness.
Lauzun made her a profound obeisance. Taking
the tips of her fingers within his hand, he kissed
them, and begged permission to be allowed the honour
of escorting her across the landing to the state
apartments. Madame de Montespan smiled; his
delicate attention flattered her vanity. Her anger
was appeased. The gay <i>sabreur</i> was returning to
his allegiance. Lauzun was now, too, a personage,
as the betrothed of Mademoiselle, and cousin-to-be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of the King. She almost repented she had urged
the King so strongly to refuse him the post of
Grand Master of the Artillery.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun, speaking in the softest and most insinuating
voice, now asked her if she had condescended,
during her recent interview with the King, to remember
his humble suit to his Majesty, for which he had
recommended himself to her all-powerful influence?</p>

<p class="i1">"This very afternoon I have done so," replied she
with the utmost effrontery. "Indeed, I have urged
your claims so strongly upon both his Majesty and
Louvois that I believe you will receive the appointment
to-morrow."</p>

<p class="i1">"How kind you are!" answered Lauzun, affecting
to smile.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes," returned the lady, "after all my eloquence,
Monsieur le Comte, you must be successful," and she
gave him one of those glances out of her serpent eyes,
whose power she knew so well.</p>

<p class="i1">"Delightful!" rejoined Lauzun aloud. "I am quite
satisfied." Then, placing his mouth close to her ear,
while a Satanic look passed over his face, he hissed
out, "Yes, I am satisfied, for now I have fairly unmasked
you. You are the greatest liar in his Majesty's
dominions!"</p>

<p class="i1">As he spoke her arm still lay confidingly on his.
In a moment he had seized and crushed it violently.
Madame de Montespan gave a piercing scream.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes," yelled Lauzun, planting himself before her—"yes,
I can prove what I say. I have heard every
word you said of me to the King. I was present—concealed."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah!" shrieked Madame de Montespan, agonised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
with pain. She stopped, and leant against the wall
for support. A look of real terror came into her face.
She turned appealingly toward Lauzun, who stood
before her glaring with passion, then, overcome by
pain and fright, she staggered, and fainting, or affecting
to faint, fell heavily upon the pavement. There
Lauzun left her. Without calling for help, he strode
rapidly down the grand staircase, and disappeared.</p>

<p class="ac">SIGNING THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-a.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A DAY is at length fixed. The contract between
Mademoiselle and Lauzun is to be signed at the
Luxembourg Palace. Mademoiselle arrays herself in
the white robe of an affianced bride. Lauzun is beside
her. He is ostentatiously humble; indeed, he
had never been thoroughly civil to her before.</p>

<p class="i1">As he enters the boudoir in her private suite of
apartments, he salutes her with his grandest air, and
kisses her hand. Mademoiselle cannot take her eyes
off him. Her senile transports are ridiculous; Lauzun
feels that they are.</p>

<p class="i1">A table is placed in the centre of the room; at this
table sits Boucherat, notary to her royal highness.
He is dressed in the quaint clerical robe, white bands,
and short wig that still distinguished his profession in
France. The marriage contract, of portentous size,
lies open on the table before him. Boucherat, a tall
spare man, with a singularly doleful expression of
countenance, looks discomposed, coughs several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
times, then, finding that no one attends to him,
looks up. Mademoiselle is talking eagerly with
Lauzun.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your royal highness—" begins Boucherat,
hesitating. "Will you permit me to address you,
madame?" he adds in a louder tone, finding Mademoiselle
pays no attention to him.</p>

<p class="i1">"What is it, my good Boucherat?" asks Mademoiselle,
turning round at last towards him.</p>

<p class="i1">Boucherat rises to his feet. He bows, standing on
the tips of his toes, then folds his arms. He is purple
in the face, and appears to be suffering acutely, especially
as, suddenly unfolding his arms, he rubs
them violently together.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun laughs. Mademoiselle cannot altogether
command her countenance.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have known your royal highness from a child,"
says Boucherat hurriedly, as though speaking between
spasms of pain. "I have had the honour of
serving your illustrious father, Gaston, Duc d'Orléans,
as notary before your birth—exalted lady." Here
Boucherat stops, gasps as if going into a fit, wipes
his forehead with his handkerchief, and adjusts his
wig.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun roars with laughter, and Mademoiselle
contemplates the notary with silent amazement.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have the honour to say,—great lady," continues
Boucherat spasmodically, "that I have known you
from a child. I have always obeyed you, blindly, as
was my duty and my pleasure. I have obeyed you
now, madame," and he utters a sound between a
snort and a groan. "I have at your command drawn
up these deeds, as you bade me. But," and he again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
stops, blows his nose violently, and makes a hideous
grimace, "I cannot allow your highness to sign these
deeds and contracts without presuming to ask you if
you have fully considered their import." Here such
a succession of twitches and spasmodic contortions
passes over his countenance, that he is scarcely
human.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have well considered what I am doing, Boucherat,"
replies Mademoiselle loftily, advancing to
the table and taking a pen in her hand.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun, no longer laughing, stands contemplating
Boucherat, with a savage expression.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your highness—permit me," pursues the notary,
not seeing him. "Is it to be an <i>entire</i> donation of
the princedom of Dombes, the county of Eu, the
dukedom of——"</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, yes, Boucherat, an entire donation," replies
Mademoiselle, interrupting him.</p>

<p class="i1">She dips the pen into the ink and prepares to
sign.</p>

<p class="i1">"An <i>entire</i> donation, madame?" gasps Boucherat,
rising noisily to his feet, then re-seating himself, and
repeating this several times in his excitement. "Let
me caution your highness——" Another snort and
a succession of loud coughs silence him.</p>

<p class="i1">"This good man will certainly have a fit," says
Mademoiselle half aloud. "What can I do with
him? Do not agitate yourself, Boucherat," and she
turns towards him. She well knows his great fidelity
and attachment to herself. "Have no fear. I know
what I am about. I shall never be more mistress of
my fortune than when I give it to this gentleman."</p>

<p class="i1">She turns round and glances fondly at Lauzun,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
who is standing behind her. She starts back at the
furious expression on his face. He looks diabolical.
His eyes are fixed on Boucherat. The pen drops
from her hand.</p>

<p class="i1">"Believe me, madame, I—I have reason for my
caution"; and again all human expression passes
from the face of the notary in a succession of the
most violent winks.</p>

<p class="i1">"How, villain! what do you mean?" cries Lauzun,
advancing. "I shall break my cane on your back
presently."</p>

<p class="i1">Boucherat rises, looks for a moment at Lauzun,
then at Mademoiselle, shakes his head, readjusts his
wig, and reseats himself.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle had taken the pen—which Lauzun
presents to her this time—again in her hand.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, your highness," groans Boucherat, "I have
done my duty. God help and guard you!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Are these deeds as I commanded them, Boucherat?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, madame; they are a donation, an <i>entire</i>
donation, of the princedom of Dombes, the——"</p>

<p class="i1">"Be silent, scoundrel!" roars Lauzun, "or by
heaven I will split your head open."</p>

<p class="i1">Boucherat shudders; his eyes seem to turn in his
head; a look of horror is on his face.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle draws the parchment towards her.</p>

<p class="i1">"I sign here," she says, and she traces her name
in a bold, firm hand, "Louise de Montpensier."</p>

<p class="i1">While she writes, Boucherat digs his hands into his
wig, which, pushed to one side, discloses his bald
head. Then with a piteous glance at his mistress,
he flings his arms wildly into the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Alas, alas! would I had died before this! the
princedom of Dombes gone—the county of Eu gone!
Oh, madame!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Be silent, madman!" roars Lauzun, "or, <i>pardieu</i>,
I will throttle you."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">The folding-doors leading into the state apartments
are now thrown open. Mademoiselle appears,
led by the Comte de Lauzun. These state apartments
had been decorated by her grandmother,
Marie de' Medici, who had lived in this palace. The
walls are ornamented with delicate arabesques,
panelled with golden borders, and painted above in
compartments. The vaulted ceilings are divided
into various designs, executed by Rubens, illustrating
the life of his royal mistress. Around hang the
effigies of the Medici and the Bourbons, the common
ancestors of Marie de' Medici and her granddaughter.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle passes round the brilliant circle
which forms itself about her, still holding Lauzun
by the hand.</p>

<p class="i1">"Permit me," says she, in her stateliest manner,
taking her position at the top of the throne-room
under a canopy—"Permit me to present to you my
future husband, the Duc de Montpensier. Let me
beg all of you in future to address him by that title
<i>only</i>."</p>

<p class="i1">The royal princes present and the great personages
of the Court bow their acquiescence. The Maréchal
de Bellefonds advances and salutes Mademoiselle.</p>

<p class="i1">"Permit me, madame," says he, addressing her,
"to congratulate you in the name of your highness's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
devoted friends. I desire to thank you especially in
the name of the nobility of France, whom I represent,
for the honour you are conferring on our
order by choosing from amongst us a consort to
share your dignity. We esteem Monsieur de Lauzun
one of the brightest ornaments of the Court; he is
worthy of the proud station for which you have
selected him."</p>

<p class="i1">"I thank you, Maréchal de Bellefonds, and I thank
the nobility of France whom you so worthily represent.
I thank you from my heart," and Mademoiselle
curtseys with royal grace. "No one is so well
acquainted as myself with the merit of Monsieur
de Lauzun," and she glances proudly at her future
husband. "I accept with pleasure the sympathy of
his friends."</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun bends, and kisses the hand of his affianced
wife.</p>

<p class="i1">Then the Maréchal de Charost steps forth from a
glittering crowd of officers. Charost is a captain in
the royal body-guard.</p>

<p class="i1">"I must also thank your highness for the honour
you confer on the army of France. My post is now
without price; for what would a soldier not give,
what sacrifices would he not make, to become the
brother-in-arms of the husband of your highness?"</p>

<p class="i1">A laugh follows this hearty outburst of enthusiasm.
It is scarcely audible, but Mademoiselle instantly
suppresses it with a frown. Lauzun is a
sacred object in her eyes, and she permits no jests,
however flattering, to mix with his name. Turning
towards the Maréchal de Charost, she replies with
haughty courtesy—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"I thank you, Maréchal, and, in your person I
thank the brave army of his Majesty, my cousin."</p>

<p class="i1">Before this august company separates it is announced
that the marriage contract is to be at once
submitted to the King, Queen, the Dauphin, the
Duc d'Orléans, and the princes of the blood-royal.</p>

<p class="i1">The marriage is to take place next day at Charenton,
at the villa of the Marquise de Créqui. The
Archbishop of Rheims is to officiate.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE, Madame de Montespan expatiated
to all the Court on the impossibility
of an alliance between Mademoiselle and the Comte
de Lauzun. That Lauzun should be received as a
prince of the blood would, according to her, for
ever lessen that dignity so dear to the heart of the
monarch.</p>

  <div class="caption">LOUVOIS.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Louvois, her creature—some said her lover—spoke
more strongly. Not only France, he said,
would be eternally disgraced, but his Majesty would
be personally censured in every Court in Europe,
for permitting one of his nearest relatives thus to
demean herself. Monsieur, father of Mademoiselle,
declared that such an alliance would be an affront
to the memory of his daughter's illustrious grandfather,
Henry the Great. Nobles and ministers, incited
by Louvois, threw themselves at the King's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
feet. They implored him not to cloud his glorious
reign by consenting to such a <i>mésalliance</i>. The
poor weak Queen, worked upon by the artifices of
the malicious De Montespan, who, as superintendent
of her household, was constantly about her
person, complained loudly of the insult about to be
put upon her circle—she a royal daughter of Spain!
All the princesses of the blood joined with her.
The cabal was adroitly managed. It attacked the
King's weak side. No man was ever such a slave
to public opinion, or so scrupulously regardful of
appearances, as Louis XIV. To him the <i>vox populi</i>
was indeed "the voice of God."</p>

<p class="i1">About eight o'clock that evening, Mademoiselle
was summoned to the Louvre from the Luxembourg.
"Was the King still at cards?" she asked
the messenger.</p>

<p class="i1">"No; his Majesty was in the apartments of
Madame de Montespan, but he desired to see her
highness the instant she arrived."</p>

<p class="i1">As Mademoiselle drove into the quadrangle, a
gentleman in waiting approached her coach, and
begged her to enter by another door, leading directly
into the private apartments. This mystery
seemed to her excited imagination full of evil import.
When she reached the King's cabinet, some
one ran out by another door. It was Madame de
Montespan. The King was sitting over the fire.
His head rested on his hand. Mademoiselle stood
before him trembling all over.</p>

  <div class="caption">BEDCHAMBER OF LOUIS XIV. AT VERSAILLES.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">"My cousin," said the King at length, rising and
offering her a seat beside his own, "what I have to
tell you makes me wretched."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Good God! Sire, what is it?" asked Mademoiselle
in a hoarse voice. She had turned as white as
the dress (that of an affianced bride) she wore. Her
eyes were fixed upon the King in a wild stare.</p>

<p class="i1">"Calm yourself, my cousin," said Louis solemnly.
"It is said by my ministers that I am sacrificing
you, my relative, to the interests of my favourite
Lauzun. I am also informed that Lauzun declares
he does not love you—that it was you who offered
yourself to him in marriage!"</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle clasped her hands, then pressed
them on her forehead. "Not love me?" she cried.
"What a base lie! Lauzun tells me he adores me."</p>

<p class="i1">"Nevertheless, my cousin, such reports must
have some foundation," resumed the King, speaking
with great gravity. "They compromise me in
my royal person; they tarnish the glory of the
Crown of France, which I wear." His look and
manner from grave had become overbearing and
pompous. It was quite evident that whatever
touched his own position he would ruthlessly sacrifice.
"My cousin, I have to announce to you that
I cannot permit this marriage." He spoke in a
loud, grating voice, raised his eyes to the ceiling,
stroked his chin with his hand, and seemed to swell
with self-consciousness.</p>

<p class="i1">A ringing scream was heard from Mademoiselle.
She lay back on her arm-chair motionless.</p>

<p class="i1">Having asserted his dignity, and conveyed in
proper terms to his cousin that neither her entreaties
nor her sufferings could for an instant be considered
when they encroached upon his royal state, Louis
relaxed his rigid attitude, condescended to turn his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
eyes downwards upon poor Mademoiselle, and in a
voice kind, spite of his sublimity, added—</p>

<p class="i1">"I am very sorry for you, my cousin, very sorry.
You have good cause to complain of me; but my
duty as King of France is supreme. I cannot permit
you to espouse the Comte de Lauzun."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, sire—" groaned Mademoiselle, in a voice so
choked by agitation it sounded strange in the King's
ears, and made him shudder; (for his selfish nature
instinctively caused him to shrink from every species
of suffering). She held out her hands supplicatingly
towards him, and vainly essayed several times to
speak. "Ah, Sire," she said at last in a voice scarcely
audible, "you cannot withdraw your word—the
word of a King. Consider," and she stopped and
burst into an agony of tears. "Consider, my cousin,
no one can have anything to do with my marriage
but myself."</p>

<p class="i1">No sooner had she uttered these words than
Louis drew himself up; the long curls of the full-bottomed
wig which covered his shoulders vibrated,
and the diamond star he wore on his coat of peach-coloured
satin glistened, so sudden had been his
action. At the same time, such a stony look came
into his hard face, as gave him the aspect of a
statue.</p>

<p class="i1">"Excuse me, my cousin, my royal dignity, the
splendour of my Court, the esteem of every crowned
head in Europe are implicated. You seem to forget
that you are born a <i>daughter of France</i>. But,
madame, I remember it, and I shall shield my royal
name from dishonour!"</p>

<p class="i1">Overcome as was Mademoiselle, she perceived the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
mistake she had made. Her brain reeled, her limbs
quivered convulsively, but she staggered to her
feet.</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, sire, hear me!" she cried. "Let me implore
you," and she threw herself before him and
clasped his knees, "do not, do not forbid me to
marry my beloved Lauzun? No ordinary rule
applies to him. Lauzun is good, great, heroic! Oh!
who would become a royal position like Lauzun?"</p>

<p class="i1">Louis did not reply. Having sufficiently asserted
his dignity, he no longer restrained his kindlier feelings.
He put his arms round his cousin, and tried
to raise her from the ground.</p>

<p class="i1">"No, no; let me kneel," cried she passionately,
clinging to him, "until you have recalled those
dreadful words. Sire, I have ever respected and
loved you. I have lived beside you as a sister. Do
not—oh! do not make my life desolate. For God's
sake, let me spend it with the only man I ever
loved! A man so made to love. Kill me! kill me!
my cousin," and she wrung her hands convulsively;
"but, if I am to live, let me live with Lauzun. I
cannot—I will not give him up!"</p>

<p class="i1">Louis rose from the arm-chair on which he was
seated. He knelt on the floor by her side. He
again took her in his arms, and laying her head
upon his breast, he soothed her like a child. Big
tears rolled down his cheeks. He called her by
every endearing name to comfort her. He did all,
save consent to her marriage.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle was drowned in tears. Vainly did
she, turning her swollen eyes upon the King, who
soothed her so fondly, strain her ears to hear that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
one little word which was to dry them. She listened
in vain; that word was never to be spoken. At last,
faint with emotion, she signed to the King to raise
her up, which he did, placing her on a chair. He
kissed her burning forehead, and pressed her dry
hands in his.</p>

<p class="i1">"My cousin," he said, "do not blame me. Rather
blame yourself. Why did you not take my advice?
I told you to lose no time. To marry at once. You
should have done so. Why did you give me time
to reflect—time for others to reflect? You ought
to have obeyed me."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle dared not confess that it was
Lauzun's fault she had not done so, but at this
recollection a fresh burst of grief choked her utterance.</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas, Sire," she moaned at last, "when did you
ever break your word before? Could I believe you
would begin with me? To break your word, too,
in such a manner!"</p>

<p class="i1">As Louis listened to her, he knit his brows, and
looked gloomy and embarrassed.</p>

<p class="i1">"I am not my own master," he replied coldly,
"in affairs touching my house and the honour of my
race."</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, if I do not marry Lauzun," groaned Mademoiselle,
almost inaudibly, "I shall die. I never
loved any other man. I ask my life of you, cousin.
Do not take my life. You are sacrificing me to a
court intrigue," she added faintly, catching at his
hand, for she was fast losing heart; "but believe me,
and let others know, that much as I love and respect
your Majesty, and desire to obey you, I will never,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
never marry another man." Holding the King's
hand, she kissed it, and gazed imploringly at him.</p>

<p class="i1">"Dear cousin, do not be so unhappy," he replied,
at a loss what answer to make to such a home-thrust,
which he knew to be so true. "Believe me, your
obedience in this matter of Lauzun will make you
doubly dear to me. You can command me in all
other ways."</p>

<p class="i1">"Nothing—nothing can give life a value without
Lauzun!" broke in Mademoiselle vehemently.</p>

<p class="i1">"My cousin," answered the King gravely, "I cannot
permit you to be sacrificed. You are made a
tool of. I cannot permit it. Now," he continued,
rising,—and with difficulty suppressing a yawn—"you
can have nothing more to say to me. I shall
not alter my determination."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle wrung her hands, the King drew
her to him and kissed her on the forehead. As he did
so, a tear dropped upon her cheek.</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh, Sire!" cried Mademoiselle, "you pity me,
and you have the heart to refuse me! You are the
master of my fate. Have mercy on me! Do not
give heed to others. Ah, Sire, you are destroying
me!"</p>

<p class="i1">"Come to me to-morrow, my cousin," said Louis
soothingly, much affected, but unshaken by her
prayers. "Come and tell me you have forgiven me.
Now, good night," and again he tenderly embraced
her. Then he summoned his attendants to conduct
her to her coach.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">"Lauzun had played deep for a great prize, and he
had lost the game. He broke out into savage abuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and called the King opprobrious names. Absolutely
maddened by rage, he rushed to the palace. He
was refused admittance. Yet he swore and cursed
at the attendants until he forced them to let him
pass. Then he strode up-stairs to the apartments of
Madame de Montespan. Here he found the King
seated by her side."</p>

<p class="i1">Louis rose, placed himself in front of the Marquise,
and faced him with a look of the gravest displeasure.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire," cried Lauzun, his face swollen with passion,
"I am come to ask you what I have done that you
should dishonour me?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Come, come, Lauzun," replied Louis, still standing
before Madame de Montespan; "calm yourself."</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun was too deep in the royal secrets to make
an open breach with him either advisable or safe.</p>

<p class="i1">"No, Sire," roared Lauzun, emboldened by the
King's calmness; "permit me to say I will <i>not</i> calm
myself. I will not permit this humiliation. There
is my sword," and he drew it from its scabbard;
"your Majesty has made me unworthy to wear it.
Take it—take my life also."</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun presented his sword. The King put it
from him with an imperious gesture.</p>

<p class="i1">"Comte de Lauzun," said he with dignity, "I refuse
to accept your sword. Let it still be drawn in
my service. There is much to wound you in what has
passed. I feel deeply for you. But my duty as King
of France compels me to act as I have done."</p>

<p class="i1">This was a bold assertion in the presence of
Madame de Montespan, who sat motionless behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the King, her cheeks blanched at the thought
of what revelations Lauzun might make in his
rage.</p>

<p class="i1">"I will make what recompense I can to you," continued
the King. "You shall be raised, Comte de
Lauzun, so high that you will cease to remember
this marriage you now so much desire."</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, I will accept no gifts, no honours, from a
monarch who has forfeited his word. Ay, Sire, I
repeat it deliberately," seeing the King's glance of
fury at his insolence, "forfeited his word. Here do
I surrender this sword, which your Majesty conferred
on me. Here do I break it, Sire, in your face as you
have broken your word."</p>

<p class="i1">As he spoke, he bent his knee, snapped the blade
in two, and violently dashed the fragments on the
ground at the King's feet.</p>

<p class="i1">"And you, perfidious woman," he continued, addressing
Madame de Montespan, "of whom I could
reveal so much, whose treachery I have proved—you
who sit there unmoved—behold your handiwork!
Do I not know that it is you, who, for your own
wicked purposes, have influenced my royal master
against me!"</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun spoke so rapidly that all this had been
said before Louis could stop him.</p>

</div>

<p class="i1">"Comte de Lauzun," broke forth the King in a
voice unsteady with passion, "leave me—leave the
palace, I command you. Presume not to insult
Madame de Montespan in my presence, or"—and he
put out his hand, grasped the gold-headed cane
which lay beside him, and strode up to where Lauzun
stood, crimson in the face—"or I shall chastise you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
as you deserve!" and Louis brandished the stick in
the air.</p>

<p class="i1">Then, as if thinking better of it, his uplifted arm
dropped to his side, he drew back some steps, flung
away the cane to the farthest corner of the room,
and, with a great effort, collected himself.</p>

<p class="i1">"Leave me!" he exclaimed, in a voice he strove
with difficulty to render calm. "Leave me instantly,
while I can still command myself. Go," and he extended
his hand with authority, "go, until you learn
how to address your Sovereign."</p>

<p class="i1">Notwithstanding these altercations, Mademoiselle
de Montpensier did not leave the Court. She was
gracious to all who approached. She looked happy,
even radiant. Lauzun, also, after a short absence,
resumed his service about the King's person. He
was sleek, prosperous, and more haughty than ever.
All this was very strange. That vindictive beauty,
Madame de Montespan, could not understand it.
Her vengeance after all had failed. The matter
must be looked into. Spies were immediately set.
Every means of inquiry the State could command
was brought to bear on Lauzun and the Princess.
Their secret was soon discovered. <i>They were married!</i></p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Montespan rushed to the King, and
announced the tremendous fact. Lauzun was
instantly arrested, and imprisoned at Pignerol.
Mademoiselle, plunged in the depths of despair, left
the Court for her Château of Eu, on the coast of
Normandy.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-i.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was the King's habit, when at Saint-Germain, to
hear early mass in the chapel. On his return,
he passed through the great gallery in which the
Court was assembled, to make their morning salutations
to him. There he also received the petitions
of all who had sufficient interest to gain admittance.
A woman, tall, finely formed, and of ample proportions,
with a stealthy glance out of magnificent black
eyes, a well-curved mouth, and a composed and
dignified bearing,—quite a style to suit the royal
taste,—with a black silk scarf edged with lace
thrown over her head, and wearing a dress of common
materials, but skilfully designed to set off her
rounded figure to the best advantage, presented herself
before him. In her hand she held a petition,
at the top of which, in large letters, was written:
"The Widow Scarron most humbly prays his Majesty
to grant——"</p>

<p class="i1">Louis read no more; his eye was gratified by the
petitioner, not by the petition, which he put into
his pocket and forgot. But the lady appeared so
often, standing in the same place in the gallery of
Saint-Germain, that his Majesty grew weary of her
sight. At length he turned his back upon her.</p>

<p class="i1">Françoise d'Aubigné, of the Protestant family of
that name, had married in her youth the poet Scarron—a
dwarf, deformed and bedridden, a lover of
loose company, and a writer of looser songs—for her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
bread. Scarron drew up the marriage contract without
the assistance of a notary. The dower of Françoise
was as follows. Four pounds a year, two
large black eyes, a fine bust, well-shaped hands, and
a great deal of <i>esprit</i>. Scarron covenanted to contribute
the hump upon his back, plenty of brains,
and a pension granted to him by the Queen-Regent,
Anne of Austria, as <i>le malade de le Reine</i>. He regretted
he could not offer either hands or feet, both
being paralysed. But he can assure his <i>fiancée</i> of a
dower which she will gladly accept—<i>Immortality</i>:
a prediction made in derision, which was strangely
justified by events.</p>

<p class="i1">In the house of her husband, this enticing daughter
of the D'Aubignés learned early "to be all things to
all men." She copied her husband's ribald songs
for him, she entertained his promiscuous circle of
friends—the gross Villarceaux, Ninon de l'Enclos,
Mademoiselle de Scudéri, a lady of the highest
virtue, but who affected Bohemian society, and many
others.</p>

<p class="i1">In process of time, Madame Scarron's youth,
beauty, and talents opened to her the salon of the
Maréchal d'Albert, where she made the acquaintance
of Madame de Sévigné, and Madame de Chalais, to
become the Princesse des Ursins. She also made a
much more important acquaintance in Madame de
Montespan. When Scarron died, she found herself
without a resource in the world. The King had disregarded
her petition. By her friends' interest she
obtained a place in the household of the Princess de
Nemours, affianced to the King of Portugal. Before
quitting France, she called on all she knew. Among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
others, she visited Madame de Montespan. To her
she related her ill-success at Saint-Germain.</p>

<p class="i1">"Why did you not come to me?" asked the favourite.
"I would have protected you. I will even
now take charge of your petition. I will see that
his Majesty reads it."</p>

<p class="i1">"What!" cried Louis, when he saw the well-known
name, "the Widow Scarron again? Why, I
am deluged with her petitions. She is become a
Court proverb, 'as importunate as the Widow Scarron.'
What do you know of the Widow Scarron,
Athanaise?"</p>

<p class="i1">The petition for the pension was nevertheless
granted, and <i>la Vueve Scarron</i>, notwithstanding
many scandalous reports of the past, was appointed
governess to the illegitimate children born to the
King and Madame de Montespan. Her devotion to
her charges was extraordinary. The King, an attached
father, was favourably impressed. He showed
his approbation by a liberal allowance, out of which
was purchased the château and estate of Maintenon,
lying in a picturesque valley beside a river, sheltered
by hills, in a woodland district between Versailles
and Chartres. From this time the Widow Scarron
was known as the Marquise de Maintenon, and became
a devout Catholic. She had her own apartments
at Court, and cut all her disreputable friends.
She was constantly present when the King visited
Madame de Montespan.</p>

</div>

<p class="i1">In the meantime, Mademoiselle de Montpensier
returned to Court. Louis XIV. could not tolerate
the absence of any of the princes and princesses of
the blood-royal, stars of the first magnitude in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
heaven where he blazed forth the centre of life and
light. Louis had sent a message to her. Mademoiselle
therefore dried her eyes, and appeared in
her usual place in the circle. Surely, she thinks, the
King will appreciate the sacrifice she is making
in being present at festivities which, by recalling so
vividly the image of Lauzun, drive her to despair!</p>

<p class="i1">A ballet is to take place at Versailles; the King is
to dance. Mademoiselle forces herself to be present.
She looks old, sad, and ill. She is preoccupied. Her
thoughts are with Lauzun, in the mountain-bound
fortress of Pignerol. There is but one person present
in that vast company she cares about. With
him she yearns to speak. It is D'Artagnan, Captain
of the Musketeers, who accompanied Lauzun to
Pignerol.</p>

<p class="i1">D'Artagnan, a Gascon, is a countryman of Lauzun.
He perfectly understands the part he has to play
with Mademoiselle; a part, indeed he had carefully
rehearsed with Lauzun while they were together.
All the time the ballet lasts, D'Artagnan, in immediate
attendance on the King, keeps his eyes fixed on
Mademoiselle with a sorrowful expression. This
agitates her extremely; she has the greatest difficulty
in keeping her seat beside the Queen.</p>

<p class="i1">Supper is served in the Queen's apartment, Louis
and Maria Theresa sit under a canopy of cloth of
gold. Hundreds of wax lights blaze in gilded stands,
and the King's twenty-four violins play. The
Dauphin, Mademoiselle, and all the princes and
princesses of the blood present are seated at the
table. The ushers and attendants admit the public
to gaze at their Majesties. Every well-dressed person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
can enjoy this privilege, and the staircases and
passages are filled with crowds ascending and descending.</p>

<p class="i1">When the tedious ceremony is over, Mademoiselle
places herself near the door, and signs to D'Artagnan
to approach.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, Captain d'Artagnan, I saw you looking at
me all the time of the ballet," she says, with a sigh.</p>

<p class="i1">D'Artagnan, a bluff, soldierly fellow, but crafty
withal, and shrewd, a good friend and a bitter hater,
salutes her respectfully.</p>

<p class="i1">"D'Artagnan," continues Mademoiselle, moving
closer beside him, and dropping her voice into a
whisper, "you have something to tell me. I see it
in your face. You accompanied Monsieur de Lauzun
to Pignerol. Tell me everything you can remember."
Her manner is quick and hurried, her breath
comes fast.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your highness, I left the Comte de Lauzun in
good health."</p>

<p class="i1">"Thank God!" ejaculated Mademoiselle, clasping
her hands.</p>

<p class="i1">She feels so faint she is obliged to ask the Queen's
permission to open the window.</p>

<p class="i1">"Was he indisposed on his long journey?"</p>

<p class="i1">"No, Madame; he was perfectly well. I never
left him. Even at night I slept in the same chamber.
Such were my instructions."</p>

<p class="i1">"Did he speak to you of me?" asked Mademoiselle
in a faltering voice, blushing deeply.</p>

<p class="i1">"Constantly, your highness. He spoke of you with
the utmost devotion. Next to the grief Monsieur
de Lauzun felt at parting from your royal highness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
I am persuaded he suffered most from the displeasure
of his Majesty."</p>

<p class="i1">"Proceed, I entreat you," breaks in Mademoiselle
eagerly. "Every word you say is inexpressibly
precious to me. When did Lauzun first speak to you
of me, and what did he say?"</p>

<p class="i1">"I must tell you," continues the artful D'Artagnan,
watching her as a cat does a mouse—"I must tell your
highness that before these unfortunate events I had
avoided the Comte de Lauzun. I imagined he
despised every one."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle shakes her head.</p>

<p class="i1">"Proper pride—a conscious superiority," she
murmurs.</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, madame, when he was arrested on St. Catherine's
day, at Saint-Germain, the Comte de Rochefort
brought him into the guard-room, and consigned
him to me. I started at once with him on his journey
to Pignerol. From time to time he gazed at me, but
did not utter a single word. When we passed your
villa at Petit Bourg, he groaned, and tears gathered
in his eyes."</p>

<p class="i1">"Poor Lauzun!" says Mademoiselle softly, lifting
up her eyes.</p>

<p class="i1">"'That villa,' said the Count to me, 'belongs to
Mademoiselle. Words cannot tell what I owe her.
She is as good as she is great.'"</p>

<p class="i1">"Did Lauzun really say this?" asks Mademoiselle,
with melting eyes.</p>

<p class="i1">"He did, madame," rejoins D'Artagnan with secret
exultation at seeing how the bait is swallowed. "'I
am unhappy, Captain d'Artagnan', he went on to say,
'unhappy, but not guilty. I have served my King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
faithfully. I have worshipped Mademoiselle—not
for her wealth, but for herself.'"</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle puts her handkerchief to her eyes.
She is convulsed with suppressed sobs.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, madame; this and much more was said to
me by the Count. Indeed, his words were so touching
that, soldier as I am, I wept, your highness—I
actually wept."</p>

<p class="i1">"Excellent man," mutters Mademoiselle, stretching
out her hand towards him. "I shall not forget
your appreciation of so noble a gentleman."</p>

<p class="i1">D'Artagnan makes a profound obeisance.</p>

<p class="i1">("My promotion is now assured," he says to himself,
"as well as poor Lauzun's pardon. Mademoiselle
has great interest with his Majesty.")</p>

<p class="i1">D'Artagnan passes his hand across his eyes, as if
to brush away tears, which he does not shed.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have seen much since I served his Majesty,"—he
continues in broken sentences, simulating deep
grief. "I am an observer of human nature;—but
never—never did I know a man of such elevation of
mind, with feelings so warm, so genuine, as Monsieur
de Lauzun. The charms of his person, the dignity
of his manners, his fortitude and patience in adversity,
are more honourable to him than the splendour
of his position as the first nobleman in France."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle, unable to contain her feelings, lays
her hand upon D'Artagnan's hand, and presses it.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your penetration does you honour, Monsieur
d'Artagnan. Yet so mean, so base is the envy of a
Court, that it is whispered about, loud enough even
for me in my exalted position to hear, that Lauzun
cares only for my revenues—not for myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Good God, what a slander!" cried D'Artagnan,
with a face of well-simulated horror.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes; but I do not believe it," hastily adds Mademoiselle.</p>

<p class="i1">"I can pledge my honour as a soldier, your highness,
it is a lie," breaks in D'Artagnan, anxious for
his friend's prospects.</p>

<p class="i1">"I know it—I know it," answers Mademoiselle
with triumph.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, madame," continues D'Artagnan, shaking
with suppressed laughter, "did I not fear to offend
your delicacy, I could say more."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah! did Lauzun speak often of me?" she asks,
and a fire comes into her sunken eyes. "Tell me."</p>

<p class="i1">"He spoke of nothing else. Day and night your
name was on his lips. My honour as a Gascon
upon it."</p>

<p class="i1">"Repeat this to me," cries Mademoiselle with
ecstasy.</p>

<p class="i1">"You little know, your highness, what tortures he
suffers at being separated from you."</p>

<p class="i1">"Alas! Monsieur d'Artagnan, he cannot suffer
more than I!" and Mademoiselle's sigh is almost a
groan.</p>

<p class="i1">"Your highness has great influence over his Majesty.
Is it possible that his imprisonment may be
shortened?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Can you doubt that my whole life, my influence,
my wealth, all I have, will be devoted to this object?"
exclaims Mademoiselle.</p>

<p class="i1">("Good," thinks D'Artagnan, "I have served my
poor friend, and I hope myself, well. What an imbecile
she is!")</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">At this moment there is a general move. The
Queen, who has been playing cards, rises, and Mademoiselle
is forced to accompany her.</p>

<p class="i1">Years pass; Lauzun still remains a prisoner at
Pignerol.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle is at the Luxembourg. She is sitting
in her closet writing, when a page enters, and
announces Madame de Maintenon. This lady is
now the recognised governess of the legitimatised
children of the King, the bosom friend of their
mother, the Marquise de Montespan. Already she
is scheming to supplant her in the King's affections.
Madame de Maintenon is singularly handsome. Her
face is pale; her complexion marble-like; her eyes
are large and lustrous, though somewhat fixed and
stern. Her glossy dark hair is raised high on her
head, and a mantilla of lace is thrown over it. Her
dress is of a sombre colour, but of the richest
material. It rustles along the ground, as, with
measured steps, she advances towards Mademoiselle.
The latter is conscious of the stately bearing of the
governess, who dares not, however, presume first to
address her. Mademoiselle does not rise, but bends
her head in acknowledgment of her salutation. She
signs to Madame de Maintenon to be seated.</p>

<p class="i1">"You are come alone, Madame," says the Princess.
"I should have rejoiced to see your little charges—those
dear children of whom I am so fond. Are they
well?"</p>

<p class="i1">"I am happy to inform your highness they are in
perfect health. The Duc de Maine looked lovely
this morning when he went with me to mass in the
royal chapel. I have come to bring you a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
letter he has written to your highness," and the
Marquise presents a note addressed in a schoolboy's
hand. "Ever since he has corresponded with you,
during his stay at Holland and at Barège, he finds such
pleasure in writing to you, I do not like to forbid it."</p>

<p class="i1">"The dear child! I love him greatly," replies
Mademoiselle, secretly wondering on what errand
Madame de Maintenon had come.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have the honour to inform your royal highness,"
says the Marquise after a pause, fixing her
black eyes keenly upon her, "my visit to you is
official. I come from the King."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle falls back in her chair; a mist
gathers before her eyes. "It must be about Lauzun
she has come!" is her first thought.</p>

<p class="i1">"But before I proceed to the subject of my
mission," continues Madame de Maintenon, speaking
in a clear metallic voice, all the while contemplating
Mademoiselle as if she were an object of
minute study—"but before I proceed, allow me to
offer to your highness the compliments of Madame
de Montespan, who is hunting at Clagny with the
King. She bids me pray you to think of everything
to please his Majesty, in order that he may be inclined
to grant what you have so much at heart."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle colours, and presses her hand to
her heart, so violently does it throb.</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame de Montespan," continues the Marquise,
"has the highest admiration for the constancy
and the fortitude you have shown on a
certain subject, madame. May I add my tribute of
sympathy also?"</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle smiles, and bows graciously. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
is not ignorant of the growing power of the governess,
and her high favour with the King.</p>

<p class="i1">"We who live at Court," adds the Marquise loftily,
"know too well how often great princes forget those
whom they once loved. Your highness is an illustrious
exception. May I, madame, be permitted to
address you on this delicate subject? It is the
purpose of my visit."</p>

<p class="i1">"I entreat you to speak," cries Mademoiselle,
greatly excited. "Tell me at once. I cannot bear
suspense. Tell me, is his Majesty about to liberate
Monsieur de Lauzun after so many years of imprisonment?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Well," replies Madame de Maintenon, with an
air of immense importance, "you shall judge,
Princess. His Majesty thinks that it is possible,
under certain conditions——"</p>

<p class="i1">"Will he acknowledge Lauzun as my husband?"</p>

<p class="i1">"He will never sanction the marriage, your highness,"
answers the Marquise decidedly, avoiding
Mademoiselle's eager gaze.</p>

<p class="i1">Here is a blow! Mademoiselle is absolutely
stunned. Madame de Maintenon proceeds in the
same monotonous tone:—</p>

<p class="i1">"His Majesty has considered the possibility of
liberating Monsieur de Lauzun, but there are difficulties,
not perhaps insurmountable, but which at
present render his gracious intention impossible."</p>

<p class="i1">"Name them," cries Mademoiselle almost fiercely,
suddenly sitting upright in her chair—"name them
instantly." She has turned ashy pale; her hands,
which she extends towards the other lady in her
agitation, tremble. She is a pitiable object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Why, the fact is," and the wily governess hems
once or twice, gives a slight cough, then clears her
voice, "his Majesty does not choose that the principality
of Dombes and the Château and estates of
Eu, with which he is informed you have invested
Monsieur de Lauzun, should go out of the royal
family. This is the difficulty which at present weighs
with the King. Madame de Montespan uses all her
eloquence in your favour, madame."</p>

<p class="i1">"I am obliged to her," answers Mademoiselle
drily. "It was rumoured that she was the person
who caused his Majesty to withdraw his consent to
my marriage."</p>

<p class="i1">This is dangerous ground, and Madame de Maintenon
hastens to change the subject; she well knows
how true are Mademoiselle's suspicions.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have nothing to do with the King's reasons,"
is her cautious rejoinder. "Doubtless they are excellent."
Then she glances towards the door as if about
to go. "Even with your royal highness I must be
excused canvassing what these reasons are. I came
simply to deliver a message with which I was entrusted,
and to carry back to his Majesty your answer."</p>

<p class="i1">This speech, delivered with the most freezing coldness,
almost frightens Mademoiselle into a fit. She
is quite unable to argue with Madame de Maintenon,
greatly her superior in intellect and in craft, specially
now, when her excited feelings barely permit
her to understand what is passing. She has sense,
however, to make a sign to the Marquise, intimating
her pleasure that she should not depart, which she
is preparing to do.</p>

<p class="i1">"His Majesty observed," continues that lady,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
looking steadfastly out of the window, "that it
seems strange these royal appanages should pass
away into an undistinguished family, while those
who are near and most dear to his Majesty are at
this time absolutely portionless—the Duc de Maine,
for instance."</p>

<p class="i1">"What!" exclaims Mademoiselle, "is it only by
enriching the Duc de Maine that the Comte de
Lauzun can be liberated?" As she puts this question
her eyes flash, and her brow darkens. Then,
seeing the stony gaze of the imperturbable Marquise
fixed upon her, she composes herself, and awaits
her reply with more calmness.</p>

<p class="i1">"I must again entreat your highness to remember,"
answers Madame de Maintenon, rising from her
chair, and dropping her eyes on the ground with
affected humility, "that I am here only as an ambassadress.
I beg your highness to excuse aught I
may have said to offend you. But, as I perceived
a way of accommodation open, I ventured to approach
you as an ambassadress—simply as an
ambassadress." These last words are spoken with
a kind of unctious hypocrisy peculiar to herself.
"Now, madame, if you permit, I will take my
leave. My duties call me back to my beloved
charges. I have been absent too long already."</p>

<p class="i1">Forthwith, every device was used to force Mademoiselle
into compliance. The little Duc de Maine
was represented as being fonder of her than of any
other creature breathing—one of those singular
attachments, in fact, that are sometimes observed in
children, and are quite unaccountable. To favour
this assertion, the worthy pupil of Madame de Maintenon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
was educated in a system of deceit. Every
morning he addressed a billet-doux to Mademoiselle,
represented as the genuine effusion of a young and
innocent heart, the same billet-doux having been
indited by his governess overnight and copied by
himself. Bouquets, presents, kisses, and caresses
were lavished in the same manner. The child played
his part so well that Mademoiselle believed at last
in this simulated attachment. Madame de Montespan
failed not, also, to pay the utmost court to
Mademoiselle, and represented to her how earnestly
she used her influence in order to induce the King
to liberate Lauzun. After these manœuvres had been
continued for some time, and the two <i>intrigantes</i>
deemed that the mind of Mademoiselle was sufficiently
prepared, Madame de Maintenon again set
forth to pay another visit at the Luxembourg
Palace.</p>

<p class="i1">This time she at once announced that the King
had determined to liberate Lauzun. Mademoiselle
in transports of joy at the intelligence, so far forgot
her dignity as to embrace the cunning messenger,
and to load her with thanks.</p>

<p class="i1">After this ebullition had a little subsided, Madame
de Maintenon gravely begged Mademoiselle not to
thank <i>her</i>. She again acted merely as an ambassadress,
she said. "But," she adds, "there is one
person who does deserve her thanks; for nothing
can exceed the earnestness with which he has urged
her highness's petition. Nay, he has not feared to
encounter the King's anger, so constant, so energetic
have been his prayers. It is to him her gratitude is
due."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Who can have been this friend—this benefactor?"
cried the Princess. "Tell me, I implore you, that I
may load him with my gratitude."</p>

<p class="i1">"I can quite understand your feelings," returned
Madame de Maintenon; "your wish to be informed
of the name of this unknown benefactor is most
natural; but to gratify you, I must break a promise—a
most solemn promise—I have made <i>never</i> to
reveal his name. He did not desire to be known he
wished to serve you in secret."</p>

<p class="i1">"Don't talk to me of secrecy, madame, in such a
moment. Tell me at once to whom I am so deeply
indebted."</p>

<p class="i1">"If I must speak," replied the inimitable De
Maintenon (rejoicing at the success of her manœuvres),
"it is the <i>Duc de Maine</i>, who prevailed on his
father to grant the petition he knew would so delight
his beloved friend and protectress. The affection he
feels towards you is indeed something——"</p>

<p class="i1">"The darling child!" exclaimed Mademoiselle,
"how I love him! Is it possible he has done this
for me! How can I reward him?—what can I do
to show him how grateful I am?"</p>

<p class="i1">This was precisely the point to which Madame de
Maintenon had been labouring to bring the Princess.
She now artfully observed that there was only one
way of rewarding the <i>disinterested</i> attachment of the
Duc de Maine in a manner worthy of Mademoiselle.
"I feel bound, however," she continued, "to warn
your highness that, after all that has been said, and
the personal interest his Majesty feels in the success
of these negotiations, he will be so incensed at any
withdrawal on your part now, that your personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
liberty—yes, madame," she repeated, seeing the
Princess's look of terror, "your personal liberty will
be in danger. You may be sent to the Bastille!"</p>

<p class="i1">The mention of such a possibility alarmed Mademoiselle
beyond measure, and she anxiously inquired
of Madame de Maintenon if she thought there was
any chance of such a misfortune.</p>

<p class="i1">"Not if by your generosity you bind his Majesty,
as it were, to fulfil the pledge he has now given,"
was the discreet reply.</p>

<p class="i1">Thus did Madame de Maintenon unfold her tactics
and work on the weak mind of the love-sick
Princess. She saw that the point was already gained,
and, fearing to destroy the favourable impression she
had made, left Mademoiselle to ruminate on the
approaching return of Lauzun, and all the happiness
in store for her. Hastening back to Versailles, she
communicated her success to the King and to Madame
de Montespan, who were equally delighted at
the triumph of their unworthy artifices.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
   <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="ac">CONNUBIAL BLISS.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-t.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Duc de Maine was invested with the principality
of Dombes and the county of Eu. The
deeds were signed in Madame de Montespan's apartments
at Versailles.</p>

<p class="i1">The sacrifice once made nothing could exceed
the ecstasy of Mademoiselle. After a separation of
many years, Lauzun would be restored to her arms!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
He was free—he would be with her in a few days!
The exquisite certainty of bliss intoxicated her
senses.</p>

<p class="i1">On her return to the Luxembourg she flew to her
room, and took a hand mirror from her toilette. She
gazed at herself in it attentively; she asked herself,
as she had already done a hundred times before,
"Can he still love me? Are my eyes bright? Are
my cheeks rosy? Is my hair abundant as in the old
days when Lauzun praised it?"</p>

<p class="i1">The examination satisfied her. Joy had effaced
the wrinkles, and brought a passing bloom back to
her face. She overlooked her grey locks, those she
could powder. Her lips parted into a smile. While
she was still looking at herself, and turning her head
in various positions in order to catch the light, a
page entered, and announced, "Monsieur de Baraille"
(he was a friend of Lauzun). Baraille's sudden
entrance startled her. She turned round abruptly,
stumbled against a chair, and the mirror, an oval of
rock crystal set in a gold frame, dropped from her
hand.</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah! Monsieur de Baraille," she cried, looking
at the fragments which strewed the floor, "why
did you come in so suddenly? This is a dreadful
omen."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle de Montpensier is at Choisy. The
agitation of her mind is indescribable. She has the
gravest reasons for displeasure. Lauzun is in France,
but shows no desire to see her.</p>

<p class="i1">At last he makes his appearance. He is dressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
in an old uniform, which he had worn before his
imprisonment; it was now too short, and too small
for him, and shabby and torn. His hair, of a reddish
shade, has fallen off during his long imprisonment,
and he wears a black wig with flowing curls,
which covers his shoulders. He enters her cabinet,
by the gallery, hung with the portraits of her ancestors.
At sight of him Mademoiselle springs to her
feet, and opens her arms to embrace him. Lauzun
throws himself on the ground before her. She raises
him, covers him with kisses, murmuring words of
fond endearment into his ear.</p>

<p class="i1">For a few moments each, overcome by widely different
feelings, remains speechless. Lauzun examines
her curiously. This inspection does not seem satisfactory.
He knits his brow, and slightly shrugs his
shoulders. Altogether his manner is far from reassuring.
He does not care to conceal his surprise at
the change he sees in the royal lady beside him. She
is now sixty, her face is pinched and lined by age;
her form bent and attenuated. She has put powder
on her grey hair, which is decked with ribbons, and
rouge upon her shrivelled cheeks, in a vain effort to
appear young. But even her blind infatuation can
no longer deceive her. She is old and she knows it.</p>

<p class="i1">"I must ask your pardon," says Lauzun at last,
breaking an awkward pause, "for having been so
long on the road to Paris to join you. My health is
very delicate, it is weakened by long confinement.
I was ill at Amboise." (The truth being that he had
been engaged in a violent flirtation with the wife of
the governor, the Marquise d'Alluye. Mademoiselle
had been informed of this.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">As Lauzun speaks, Mademoiselle raises her eyes,
and looks him in the face. It was the same deep
harmonious voice, full of subtle melody, that had
once charmed her ear, like a cadence of sweet music.
There were the same clear eyes, whose glance ruled
her destiny. Those eyes that had haunted her day
and night for so many years, through the mists of
time and absence. There were the features whose
every turn she had studied with unutterable tenderness;
those lips which had parted to utter words on
which hung her very life. There before her was her
Lauzun,—the object of such longing desire, such
torturing suspense; of such eager strivings, of such
willing self-sacrifice. But oh, how changed!</p>

<p class="i1">Now the scales had fallen from her eyes. For
the first time she saw him as he was. He was her
Lauzun no longer. She felt that she was repugnant
to him. An agony of grief welled up within her;
she could have screamed for very bitterness of soul
in the wild impulse of her despair. But at this
supreme moment her pride came to her support.
Should she let him mock the strivings of her tortured
spirit? gauge the abyss of her misery with his cold
steely eye? No; mortal as were the wounds his
cruelty had inflicted, they should still be sacred. She
would say nothing. As she looks at him (and, looking
at him, gazes also through the long vista of years
that his presence recalls) she composes her countenance
to an unnatural calmness, and she replies to
him, in a voice almost as careless as his own—</p>

<p class="i1">"It gives me infinite pain to hear that you have
been ill, but I rejoice to see you so perfectly restored.
I never saw you looking better in my life."</p>

  <div class="caption">MADAME DE MAINTENON.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">A glare of anger passed into Lauzun's eyes, and
he frowned. Again there was a long and awkward
pause.</p>

<p class="i1">"You have laid out a great deal of money here at
Choisy," he says with a sneer, his eyes wandering
round. "I think you have been ill-advised to purchase
this place. It is a mere <i>guinguette</i>, lying in a
hole. What a useless building it is—so ill designed
too!" and he casts his eyes contemptuously down
the suite of rooms, the doors of which are open.</p>

<p class="i1">"Some people think it is not good enough for
me," answers Mademoiselle, with forced calmness,
although her lips tremble in spite of herself.</p>

<p class="i1">"Have you paid for it, madame?" asks Lauzun,
with the utmost impertinence.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have paid for it," replies the Princess.</p>

<p class="i1">Lauzun now rises, and strides up and down the
cabinet. He strolls into the adjoining gallery, eying
the precious ornaments with which the tables are
covered. He takes the most valuable articles in his
hands and carefully examines them, holding them up
against the light. Then he returns, stands opposite
Mademoiselle, and examines her features with a stare
of cynical scrutiny. She grows crimson under this
insolent inspection, but says nothing.</p>

<p class="i1">"You would have done much better to have given
me the money you have squandered here. I have
suffered great misery."</p>

<p class="i1">"I have given you too much already, Monsieur de
Lauzun," replies Mademoiselle, in an unsteady voice,
for his heartless greed smote her to the very soul.</p>

<p class="i1">"I fear you are horribly cheated," adds Lauzun,
not noticing her reply. Again he walks up and down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the room. "I could manage matters much better for
you. Will you make me your treasurer?"</p>

<p class="i1">He speaks eagerly, and there is a hungry gleam in
his eye that bodes ill for Mademoiselle's revenues.</p>

<p class="i1">"No, I will not," answers Mademoiselle, firmly.
"If you want to know, I have paid for this place
forty thousand livres. I sold my string of pearls to
purchase it."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh! you have sold your string of pearls without
consulting me?" interrupts Lauzun with an offended
air. "What waste! What folly!"</p>

<p class="i1">He stops in his pacing up and down the room, and
fixes his eyes upon her in another silent scrutiny.</p>

<p class="i1">"I see you still wear coloured ribbons in your hair.
Surely, at your age, this is ridiculous."</p>

<p class="i1">"The Queen does the same."</p>

<p class="i1">"Are you not older than the Queen?"</p>

<p class="i1">"I am old, Monsieur de Lauzun," replies Mademoiselle,
stung to the quick, yet speaking with dignity;
"but persons of my rank dress according to established
etiquette. Have you nothing more to say to
me, Lauzun?" she says, in a low voice.</p>

<p class="i1">She can bear no more; her pride and her fortitude
are rapidly forsaking her. She feels she is breaking
down, spite of herself. She longs inexpressibly to fold
Lauzun in her arms, to tell him all her love; to beseech
him to return it, even ever so little a return, for
that vast treasure she offers. But she is withheld by
absolute shame.</p>

<p class="i1">"I have made great sacrifices to restore you to
liberty, Lauzun," she continues, timidly, her voice
almost failing her, and not daring to look up at him
for fear of encountering his chilling gaze. "I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
made many sacrifices. I understood that you approved
of them." Lauzun does not answer. Mademoiselle
speaks humbly now, for what is money, contempt, insult
to her, so that he would love her, only a little?
"I have also made arrangements with Colbert to pay
your debts."</p>

<p class="i1">"I am obliged to you," replies Lauzun, with a
sneer. "Let me tell you, however," and he advances
close to where she is sitting and fixes his eyes fiercely
upon her—"Let me tell you I would rather command
the Royal Dragoons and be back again at Court in
attendance on the King, than have all the money you
have, or ever can give me."</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle turns very faint, and clasps her
hands. Her eyes close, as if she is going to swoon.
Lauzun contemplates her unmoved. He does not
offer her the smallest assistance.</p>

<p class="i1">"Good God!" she exclaims after a while, "how
much I am to be pitied! I have despoiled myself
and you are ungrateful."</p>

<p class="i1">"Louise," says Lauzun, feeling he has gone too
far, stooping and trying to kiss her hand, "spare me
hysterics. Let us talk business."</p>

<p class="i1">"We have talked nothing else," cries Mademoiselle,
her indignation rising at his heartless indifference.
"Not a word of affection has come from your
lips," her voice grows thick and tears rush into her
eyes. Spite of herself, she is rapidly giving way.
It was the old fight between heart and no heart, man
who feels nothing, woman who feels everything.</p>

<p class="i1">"I want my place at Court," says Lauzun, abruptly.
"Will you use your influence to reinstate me? Else,
I would rather have remained in prison at Pignerol."
He speaks in a tone of the bitterest reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"I will do what I can," Mademoiselle answers in
a husky voice.</p>

<p class="i1">"Do what you can!" retorts Lauzun, turning
upon her savagely, "do what you can! <i>Morbleu</i>, if
you answer me like that, I will tell you the truth.
You have ruined me—you have destroyed my reputation—lost
me my position. Louise d'Orléans, I
wish I had never seen you!"</p>

<p class="i1">"It is false," returns Mademoiselle, in a loud
voice, her passion rising at his injustice; "it is false.
I have not injured you—the King will tell you so
himself." Lauzun is growing more and more defiant,
almost threatening. His hand rests on the hilt of
his sword. This is too much even for her to bear.
"If you have nothing more to say, Monsieur de
Lauzun, leave me." She speaks with the habit of
command long years have given her.</p>

<p class="i1">"I will not go," cries he; "you have no right to
order me. <i>Am I not your husband?</i>" Lauzun hisses
out these last words, more like a venomous serpent
than a man. He grasps the arm of Mademoiselle,
who shrinks away from him. His whole bearing is
wild and menacing. "You leave me without money,
you who have lost me all I value in the world; you,
who are old enough to be my mother!" Mademoiselle
covers her face with her hands, she cowers before
him. "Can you deny it? Instead of providing
me with a proper residence and equipage when I
came out of prison, I have not even a carriage of my
own. I am in miserable lodgings with Rollinde, one
of your people, while <i>you</i>—you live in a palace. I
have no money to pay my debts."</p>

<p class="i1">"It is false," she replies, rising and facing him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
boldly. "I <i>have</i> paid your debts. If you have fresh
ones they are gambling debts. Those I refuse to
pay."</p>

<p class="i1">"But you shall!" roars Lauzun, stamping his foot
and raising his hand as if to strike her. "I am your
husband. I have a right to all you have."</p>

<p class="i1">"I will pay no more," shrieks Mademoiselle, now
excited beyond fear. "Go to your friends, those
ladies you love so well, Madame de Montespan and
the others." She clenches her fist as the bitter pangs
of jealousy shoot through her soul. "I will not pay
such debts," she repeats; then she draws herself up,
and faces him with a courage he has never seen in
her before. It calms him instantly.</p>

<p class="i1">"Look at these diamond buttons you sent me.
They are vile. You have such splendid jewels!"
He lifts up his lace ruffles and displays a pair of
solitaire diamonds of great beauty, which fasten
his wristbands. He is as fawning and eager as a
beggar.</p>

<p class="i1">"I will give you other diamonds," answers Mademoiselle
with composure. "But what I do for you
in future depends on your own conduct, Monsieur de
Lauzun, or rather Duc de Montpensier, for such I
have created you."</p>

<p class="i1">There was a depth of irony in thus addressing him
by his title at this particular moment.</p>

<p class="i1">"Well, madame, as you please," answers Lauzun,
contemptuously scanning her all over. "If I am not
satisfied I shall go abroad and command foreign
armies. I will go <i>anywhere</i> to rid myself of you. I
hope never to see you again," and a look of undisguised
hatred flashes from his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"You need not go far to rid yourself of me," cries
Mademoiselle, incensed beyond bounds. "Leave me
instantly, ungrateful man! You have sufficiently
outraged me. In the presence too of my great ancestors,"
she adds, and with a stately action she extends
her hand towards the portraits which hang around;
"those ancestors, one of whose time-honoured titles
I have given you. You might, I think, have chosen
a more suitable spot for your insults," and she measures
him from head to foot. Then with an imperious
gesture she points to the door.</p>

<p class="i1">Still they met, Mademoiselle still clung to Lauzun.
In the month of September they are together at
Choisy for a few days. Lauzun has enormous gambling
debts and wants money, therefore he is come.
On returning one evening from hunting he sees
Mademoiselle seated under the shade of one of the
fine old elms in the park, her favourite tree. She is
in tears. It is nine o'clock at night, she has long
awaited his return; now it is nearly dark. Lauzun
gallops up to where she sits. He dismounts, gives
his horse into the hands of a servant, and casts
himself on the grass besides her. By so doing he
splashes her dress with mud, but he offers no apology.
He unfastens the heavy hunting boots he wears, and
endeavours to draw them off, but he does not succeed.
Then he turns suddenly round and thrusts
them into her face.</p>

<p class="i1">"Here, Louise d'Orléans," he says, "make yourself
useful; take off my boots." Mademoiselle
betrays no emotion, she only rises and returns to
the house.</p>

<p class="i1">They never met again. A brief record remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of her existence, graven on the tomb, where she lay,
among "the daughters of France," unloved—unmourned;
a sad example, that riches to a woman are
too often a curse. The brief record is as follows:—</p>

<p class="i1">"Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, eldest daughter of
Gaston de France: Souveraine Princesse de Dombes,
Princesse Dauphine d'Auvergne, Comtesse d'Eu,
Duchesse de Montpensier; died 1693, aged sixty-six."</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">FALL OF DE MONTESPAN.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-a.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ABOUT this time Madame de Maintenon announced
to the King that she had received a
mission from Heaven to convert him from the error
of his ways. "I was brought to Court miraculously
for this purpose; God willed it," she writes to her
daughter. Singularly enough, this conviction of her
mission coincided with the absence of Madame de
Montespan at the baths of Bourbon.</p>

<p class="i1">Louis had come to view these temporary absences
as a relief. He had grown somewhat weary of the
once-adored Marquise. He inclined to think the
society of Madame de Maintenon preferable. In her
company the charms of friendship exceeded the
delights of love. She was leading him up to Heaven
by an easy path strewn with flowers. Conscious as
he was of his past sins, he yet liked the process of
repentance.</p>

<p class="i1">The apartments of Madame de Maintenon at Versailles,
on the same floor as his own, were well placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
for constant intercourse. They no longer exist, but
the situation is identified as having been near the
south wing, contiguous to his own suite, which was
separated from that of the Queen by the Salle de
l'Œil de Bœuf, a corridor, and some smaller rooms.</p>

<p class="i1">The affection of her pupil, the Duc de Maine, and
the esteem and approval of the Queen, strengthened
Madame de Maintenon's position. Maria Theresa
quite venerated the <i>ci-devant</i> Veuve Scarron.</p>

<p class="i1">Maria Theresa, who refused to doubt La Vallière's
purity, and who long defended the virtue of Madame
de Montespan, was born to be a dupe. Her unsuspicious
nature fell an easy prey to the duplicity of
Madame de Maintenon, who would have imposed on
a stronger-minded person than the guileless Queen.
The King carefully intensified these good impressions.
He confided to his consort the conviction of
Madame de Maintenon that he would infallibly be
"damned" if he did not cleave to herself alone, and
live with her in love and unity. Such words from
the lips of her august husband, whom she had all her
life worshipped too entirely to have dared to appropriate
to herself, won the Queen's whole heart.
Never had she been so blessed. Her Olympian
spouse spent hours beside her; his conduct was exemplary.
Maria Theresa, overcome by the weight
of her obligations to the wily <i>gouvernante</i>, treated
her with the utmost distinction. She joined with
the King in appointing her lady in waiting to the
new Dauphine.</p>

<p class="i1">By-and-by Madame de Montespan, having finished
her course of drinking and bathing at Bourbon,
returned. That the waters had agreed with her was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
evident. Her eyes were more voluptuous, her
aspect more enticing than ever. For a time the
King's conviction of Madame de Maintenon's
mission wavered; he forgot his salvation.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Maintenon, invested with the authority
of a Christian prophetess, denounced his apostacy.
Madame de Montespan was furious; quarrels
ensued between herself and Madame de Maintenon,
in which the choleric, frank-spoken sinner was over-ruled
by the crafty saint. The King, called in as
umpire, decided always in favour of the latter; she
could clothe her wrongs in such eloquent language,
she was so specious, so plausible, she continued to
identify herself so entirely with his salvation, that
he again became repentant. His coldness towards
herself increased. This rival, the governess of her
children, insulted Madame la Marquise de Montespan.
Her fury knew no bounds. She felt that her
fall was approaching; that the ground on which she
stood was undermined. She denounced her treacherous
governess to the King; she declared that
the Veuve Scarron had not been immaculate. She
even caused a pamphlet to be printed in which
names, places, dates, and details were given. She
showed it to the King; Louis shook his head, and
replied that she had herself defended her <i>protégée</i>
so ably that he was unalterably convinced of her
virtue. The Marquise de Montespan was bowed
out of Versailles.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">The influence of Madame de Maintenon changed
the atmosphere of the Court. A holy calm succeeded
to strife and agitation. Gallantry, gambling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
intrigues, and women no longer formed the staple
of general conversation. Religious discussions, theological
disputes, and ecclesiastical gossip became the
fashion. Anecdotes of the various Court confessors
were discussed in the Œil de Bœuf with extraordinary
eagerness. The priest of Versailles was a
more important personage than a royal duke;
Bossuet had more influence than Louvois; Père la
Chaise overtopped the great Louis himself. The
Court ladies became decided prudes, rolled their
eyes sanctimoniously, wore lace kerchiefs, renounced
rouge, and rarely smiled. No whisper of scandal
profaned the royal circle. His Majesty was subdued
and serene, assiduous in the affairs of religion, and
constant in his attendance on his comely directress.</p>

<p class="i1">On the 30th July, 1683, the Queen died. She expired
in the arms of Madame de Maintenon. On
her death-bed she gave her the nuptial ring which
she had received from his Majesty. This gift was
significant.</p>

<p class="i1">The concealed ambition of Madame de Maintenon,
her greed of dominion, the insolence of the inferior
about to revenge the wrongs suffered in her obscurity,
a sense, too, of her own power, now roused her
to grasp that exalted position which, even while the
Queen lived, had tempted her imagination. Now
began a system of coquetry, so refined, as to claim
the distinction of a fine art. The lady is forty-five,
and looks young and fresh for her age; her hair is
still black and glossy; her forehead smooth, her skin
exquisitely white; her figure lissom and upright, if
ample. There is a hidden fire in her stealthy eyes;
a grandeur in her bearing, that charms while it imposes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Not all the vicissitudes of her chequered
career can wash out the blood of the D'Aubignés
which flows in her veins. The old King is desperately
in love with her. It is the first time in his life
he has encountered any opposition to his will. There
is a novelty in the sensation wonderfully enthralling.
The conquest of a lady who can thus balk him acquires
an enormous importance in his eyes. He has
run the fortune of war both at home and abroad;
he has carried fortresses by storm, assailed the walls
of great cities; he has conquered in the open plain;
but here is a female citadel that is impregnable. His
attack and her defence are conducted in daily interviews,
lasting six, and even ten hours. If he can
win her, he feels too that his salvation is insured.
A life of repentance passed with such an angel, is a
foretaste of celestial bliss. There is something
sublime in the woman who can reconcile earth with
heaven, and satisfy his longings in time and eternity.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">Suddenly Madame de Maintenon announces her
intention of leaving the Court for ever.</p>

<p class="i1">The King who occupies his usual place in her
saloon, sitting in an arm-chair placed between the
door leading into the antechamber and the chimney-piece,
listens with speechless dismay.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Maintenon, who sits opposite to him,
on the other side of the chimney-piece, in a recess
hung with red damask, a little table before her,
stitches calmly at the tapestry she holds in her
hand. She affects not to observe him, and continues
speaking in a full firm voice. "My mission is
accomplished, Sire. I have been permitted to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the humble instrument of leading your Majesty to
higher and holier thoughts. Your peace with Heaven
is now made. I desire to retire, leaving my glorious
work complete."</p>

<p class="i1">"What, madame! Do I hear aright? You propose
to leave me?—me, a solitary man, to whom
your society is indispensable?" There is a deep
longing in the King's eye as it rests upon her, a
tremulous solicitude in his manner that she observes
with secret joy.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, I implore you to allow me to depart. I
yearn for repose. I have remained at Court greatly
against my will, solely for your advantage."</p>

<p class="i1">"Remain always," murmurs the King, contemplating
her fondly; "my life—my happiness—my
very being is bound up in you. Deprived of you, I
may again fall into deadly sin. Do not forsake me."</p>

<p class="i1">These last words are spoken in a whisper, full of
tenderness. He rises from his arm-chair and approaches
her. Madame de Maintenon looks at him
sharply; then moves her chair backwards. Louis
stops midway and gazes at her timidly. He returns
to his arm-chair, and sighs profoundly.</p>

<p class="i1">"Impossible, your Majesty," replies the Marquise
stiffly, arranging the folds of her dress. "I repeat,
my task is done. The Court is reformed, your salvation
secure. But, while benefiting others, I have
exposed myself to calumny. Sire, I am called your
mistress. I am branded as the successor of Madame
de Montespan."</p>

<p class="i1">"What villain has dared to assail your immaculate
virtue? Tell me who he is, and there is no
punishment he shall not suffer," and the King's face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
flushes scarlet. There is the old look of command
upon his brow—the old decision in his manner.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire," answers Madame de Maintenon quietly,
"such passion is unnecessary. I am not worthy of
it. I have already done all that is needful, let me
go. I can serve you no longer."</p>

<p class="i1">"You are worthy, madame, of all that a man—that
a monarch can lay at your feet," cries Louis
with enthusiasm. A cynical smile plays upon her
full-lipped mouth while the King speaks.</p>

<p class="i1">"I am at least worthy of respect, Sire. The suspicion
of impurity is intolerable. I cannot bear it;
I must go."</p>

<p class="i1">"You are too hurried, dearest madame," returns
the King; "too impressionable. Whatever observations
may be aroused by our intimacy, and my
well-known attachment to you, they should not
annoy you. Your character is an all-sufficient defence."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, Sire, this is not sufficient. I must fly from
even the semblance of suspicion. You are a single
man, I am a widow. I must leave Versailles. Your
Majesty cannot wish me to remain, to become an
object of contempt."</p>

<p class="i1">"Contempt? Impossible!" exclaims Louis abruptly.
"No woman whom I, the King of France,
have loved, has ever suffered contempt."</p>

<p class="i1">No sooner were these words out of his mouth,
than the King had reason to repent having uttered
them. The outraged prude burst into a flood of
tears. After all, was her crafty scheming to be in
vain? Would Louis not understand that as a wife—and
a wife only—she would remain?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Ah, Sire," sobs she with genuine sorrow, "is this
the return you make for my too great devotion to
your Majesty's salvation? I, who have led you step
by step towards that Deity, whose wrath your transgressions
had so justly incensed? Is it for this I
have rescued you from the flames of Purgatory—the
fire of everlasting Hell?"</p>

<p class="i1">Louis turns ghastly pale; a nervous tremor seizes
him. He dare not look Madame de Maintenon in
the face, for her piercing black eyes glare upon him,
and seem to scan his inmost soul. He dare not
interrupt her; he must listen to all she has to say, so
great is her empire over him.</p>

<p class="i1">She continues:—</p>

<p class="i1">"Am I sunk so low in your esteem that you
mention me in the same breath with a Montespan,
a Fontanges? Alas, I have soiled my good name
to serve you, and is <i>this</i> then my recompense?"</p>

<p class="i1">As she speaks, in a hard resolute voice, her reproachful
eyes rivet themselves upon Louis.</p>

<p class="i1">"Do you forget, Sire, that I am the woman whom
your sainted Queen specially esteemed? On whose
bosom she expired? To whom, as she drew her
dying breath, she gave this ring?"</p>

<p class="i1">She takes from her finger the nuptial ring which
Maria Theresa had given her. It was a single diamond
of remarkable brilliancy. After contemplating
it for an instant she drops it on the floor, midway
between herself and Louis, then, with a stately
gesture, she rises to depart.</p>

<p class="i1">The impress of many passions is visible on the
countenance of the aged monarch. Love and pride
are written there. Pride is on his broad forehead—in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
the carriage of his head—in his arched and bushy
eyebrows—in his still erect form—in the action of
his hands and arms, as they grasp the chair on which
he sits upright. Pride, intense, inflexible pride.
But his dark eyes glow with passion. Those eyes
devour Madame de Maintenon, as she stands erect
before him, her eyes turned towards heaven, the
ring at her feet. His mouth, around which deep
wrinkles gather, works—as did his father's—with a
nervous spasm; but the parted lips seem to pant
for the beloved object before him. At length he
raises himself slowly from his chair—stoops—picks
up the nuptial ring of his first wife—kisses it, and
places it on the finger of Madame de Maintenon.</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Mon amie</i>," he says, with solemnity, "do not
leave me. As your husband I will defend you."</p>

<p class="i1">Even in the reign of Louis XIV. public opinion
made itself heard. Placards appeared upon the walls
of Paris to this effect:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="i1">"<span class="sc">Lost</span>—The Royal Sceptre. The finder
will be well rewarded."</p></div>

<p class="i1">The next day was announced, in the same place:</p>

<p class="i1">"The Sceptre found—Discovered on the toilette of a hypocrite.</p>

<p class="i1">Other placards followed; they ran as follows:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is the winter of 1685. The night is dark and
starless. Fast falling snow makes the air thick
and covers the ground as with a white mantle. An
icy blast is blowing, chilling alike to man and beast.
As eleven o'clock strikes, the Archbishop of Paris
leaves his palace, spite of the inclement weather.
He is alone in his coach. Midnight is past when
he draws up outside the great gates of Versailles.
These open silently. He drives onward, traversing
the vast courtyard, passing the equestrian statue
of Louis XIV., until he reaches the Cour de Marbre,
between the two pavilions of the central portion of
the château. Here the outer portal at the foot of
the grand staircase is ajar. Bontemps, Governor of
the Palace of Versailles, valet, confidant, and purveyor
generally to the wants of his Majesty, stands
behind it awaiting the Archbishop. He holds a
light, which he carefully shades with his hand.
Monseigneur de Harlay, Archbishop, descends from
his coach shivering all over. His teeth chatter in
his head, not only from the cold which is excessive,
but from apprehension of what he is about to engage
in. Bontemps precedes him up the stairs, holding
the light in his hand. They traverse whole suites of
rooms, a spacious hall, a long gallery, and many corridors.
No word is spoken, every soul is asleep, and
it is urgent they should remain so. Once within the
King's apartments all is light, warmth, and luxury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
The well-nigh frozen dignitary revives. Before him
is the King, dignified, composed, and cheerful. With
him are the Marquis de Montchevreuil and the Chevalier
de Forbin, as witnesses; Père la Chaise is also
there to assist the Archbishop. An altar is dressed
in the centre of the room. As soon as his Majesty
has saluted Monseigneur de Harlay, Bontemps is despatched
to fetch Madame de Maintenon. She loses
no time in appearing. The marriage rites are performed
by Père la Chaise, confessor to the King; the
benediction is given by the Archbishop.</p>

<p class="i1">The marriage is to be secret; but Louis XIV.
henceforth addresses her as "<i>Madame</i>." He receives
his Ministers in her saloon; the Marquis de Maintenon
the while sitting upon a fauteuil in his presence.
These are royal honours. Monseigneur le Dauphin
and the princes of the blood never forgive the marriage.
The contempt and hatred they feel towards
Madame de Maintenon cannot be concealed. As
favourite they had tolerated her; as wife they rebel
against her. Yet her will is law. The Duc de
Maine and the Duc and Duchesse de Bourgogne,
son and daughter-in-law to Monseigneur, are the
only exceptions.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">We are again at Choisy. Every window is a blaze
of light, the terraced garden flashes with millions of
coloured lamps. The Dauphin and his consort, the
princes and princesses, courtiers, singers, actors, and
poets, fill the foreground. Brocade and satin sweep
the terraces; cocked hats and feathers, ribbons, lace,
plumes, jewels, orders, wave and glitter. There is
the sound of laughter and mad jest—joyous music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and voluptuous feasting, <i>petit soupers</i> and masked
balls, theatricals and concerts.</p>

<p class="i1">Long flights of marble stairs descend through
bosky groves, sweet with the scent of lilac and
honeysuckles, to the Seine, on whose grassy banks,
illuminated by torches and bonfires, a flotilla of
boats are moored under the overhanging woods.
If the essence of all the fêtes given in France was
concentrated, the result would be Choisy before the
Revolution. In the hands of Monseigneur it is a
miniature court, rivalling what Versailles was; a
court where youth, joy, and beauty reign supreme.
Louis, now old, desires that all the world should be
old likewise—fast, pray, confess, and hear sermons
like himself. Choisy is a scandal to him. The
Dauphin receives orders to quit, and take up his
abode at Meudon. Monseigneur, a short, stout,
thick-set man, with a fair complexion, and what
would have been handsome features had his nose
not been broken, appears before Madame de Maintenon,
the real ruler of France. She is seated in her
apartments, working as usual at her tapestry. She
does not rise at his entrance, and her aspect is severe
and repellant.</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame," says the Dauphin, seating himself at
a gesture she makes, "can you explain to me what
motive has induced his Majesty to banish me from
my favourite residence at Choisy?"</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Maintenon does not raise her eyes
from her work. "Banishment you call it, Monseigneur;
you mistake the term. Not banishment,
simply a change of abode designed for your good,
by his Majesty, your august father."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"For my good? surely I am of an age to judge
for myself! If I cannot live where I please, I am
under arrest. I am not aware in what I have
merited the royal displeasure."</p>

<p class="i1">"Observe, Monseigneur le Dauphin," answers
the Marquise, fixing her black eyes upon him, "the
King feels no displeasure; on the contrary, he
desires your more constant presence at his Court, near
his person." The Marquise spoke these words with
special emphasis.</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame, I am most grateful for the amiable
manner in which you express his Majesty's flattering
wish, but might not some plan be found to unite my
presence at Court with my residence at Choisy?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Impossible, your highness. In a monarchy there
can be but one sovereign. The Court must surround
that sovereign. Now, permit me to observe, there
are two courts, and something like two sovereigns."</p>

<p class="i1">"I am not conscious, madame," replies the
Dauphin, with dignity, "what action of my life
justifies such an accusation. If his Majesty desires
to reprimand me, as a father, I ask the favour of
hearing it from his own lips."</p>

<p class="i1">"Monseigneur," replies Madame de Maintenon,
with affected humility, "it is his Majesty who speaks
by my voice. I am less than nothing other than
through him. If you desire to know what causes
his displeasure, it is that in the magnificent fêtes
you give at Choisy he observes that one most important
element of society is omitted—an element
his Majesty considers essential."</p>

<p class="i1">"What element, madame?"</p>

<p class="i1">"That of the Church, your Highness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The Dauphin is suddenly convulsed with a fit of
violent laughter. He takes a hasty leave.</p>

<p class="i1">"The Church at Choisy, <i>ma foi</i>!" he says aloud
when he has safely passed the anteroom and is well
beyond hearing. "My old master Bossuet, and Bourdaloue,
and the Versailles Jesuits assisting at midnight
fêtes at Choisy—what a notion! I must tell
this to Mademoiselle Choin. How she will
laugh!"</p>

<p class="i1">Charlotte de Bavière, second wife of Philippe
d'Orléans, brother of the King, hated the "old
woman," as she called Madame de Maintenon. She
saw through her and despised her. Madame de
Maintenon returned her animosity with interest, but
she dared not provoke her. There was something
about this frank, downright German princess that
was not to be trifled with. Whatever her eccentricities
might be, they were respected; she was left
in peace to drink as much beer and to eat as many
<i>saucissons</i> as the peculiarity of her constitution
required.</p>

<p class="i1">In person she was actually repulsive; her pride
was a by-word and a jest; but she was a faithful
friend and a true wife, and continued to live with
her heartless and effeminate husband, Monsieur, in
peace.</p>

<p class="i1">On her son, the Duc de Chartres, afterwards the
Regent Orléans, she doted. In her eyes he was perfect.
She was either blind or indifferent to his vices.
But even he was not exempt from the violence of her
temper. When she was told that he had consented
to a marriage with Mademoiselle de Blois, daughter
of Madame de Montespan, she struck him in the face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Then she flew to the King. The doors of the royal
bedchamber are closed by the attendant Swiss, but
the angry voices of Charlotte (Madame) and Louis in
angry altercation, penetrate into the gallery of the
Œil de Bœuf, where the Court awaits the moment
of the royal lever.</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire," Madame is heard to say in her guttural
German-French accent, "I am come to forbid the
marriage of my son with Mademoiselle de Blois."</p>

<p class="i1">"How, my sister?" replies the full, deep voice of
the King, that voice which usually created so profound
an impression on the nerves of those whom he
addressed.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, to forbid it. Had your Majesty desired an
alliance between my son and a daughter of your consort,
Maria Theresa, I should have considered it my
duty to submit."</p>

<p class="i1">"Oh!" exclaims the King in a loud voice, and
quick steps are heard pacing up and down the room,
"you would have condescended to accept a princess-royal
for your daughter-in-law."</p>

<p class="i1">"Certainly, Sire; but because I committed a <i>mésalliance</i>
myself in marrying your brother, Philippe
de Orléans——"</p>

<p class="i1">"<i>Pardieu!</i> Madame," breaks in the King. "Do
you talk of a <i>mésalliance</i> with a grandson of Henry
the Great?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Certainly I do, your Majesty. What was Henry
the Great, but an obscure Prince of Béarn, a beggarly
little State among the valleys of the Pyrenees? Does
your Majesty think that the hundred quarterings of
my escutcheon will gain lustre by the arms of
Bourbon?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Louis is heard to stamp on the floor. "Madame,"
he cries, so loud that his words echo into every
corner of the Œil de Bœuf, "Madame, you forget
yourself. How dare you come here to insult me?"</p>

<p class="i1">"Sire, I come here to tell you the truth. My son,
the Duc de Chartres, has forgotten himself by listening
for one instant to your proposal. With my own
hand I have chastised him as he deserves. I do not
forget myself, whatever others may do. Philippe is
too good for any princess in Europe. The blood in
his veins is that of my ancestors—the Princes Palatine
of the Rhine. We laugh at your modern houses—we
laugh! Philippe is the best man in your Court.
He knows everything—painting, music, poetry, science.
None of you can understand him. You are
too ignorant."</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame," the King is heard to say, "have a care—you
are going too far!"</p>

<p class="i1">"No, my brother, I have not gone far enough,"
rejoins Madame. "You have forgotten the siege of
Mons, where he fought under your own eyes—also
Steinkerque and Nerwinde. It is your fault that
Philippe does not command your armies. He is equal
to it. Who would not have such a husband? Sire,
my son, the Duc de Chartres, shall never wed with
your bastard!"</p>

<p class="i1">Again Louis is heard to stamp upon the floor.
Then, in a voice hoarse with rage, he replies, "Madame,
I shall hold my brother responsible for your
insolence."</p>

<p class="i1">"Why have you provoked it, then?" is the reply
in a calmer tone. Charlotte de Bavière has evidently
relieved her own violence by exciting that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
King. "I have a right to resist such a disgraceful
proposal. Withdraw your marriage, and I am again
your good sister and friend as heretofore."</p>

<p class="i1">"We shall see, Madame, we shall see!" shouts the
King, whose usual courtesy towards women is not
proof against such an attack.</p>

<p class="i1">"Yes, Sire, we shall see. No person on earth shall
make me sanction a blot on my name. My opposition
shall not be only in words. The Duc de Chartres
is my only son. I will stop the marriage in your
presence. I will stop it at the altar of the chapel-royal."</p>

<p class="i1">"Madame, your pride has turned your head. But
your husband, my brother, shall obey me."</p>

<p class="i1">"Your brother, Sire, will, I know, in this, as in
all else, be advised by me. I can defend the honour of
his house much better than he can himself, and he
knows it. Your brother will do his duty, I shall do
mine. I wish your Majesty good-day."</p>

<p class="i1">The sound of the King's cane is audible, striking
heavily on the floor as he strides up and down the
room. The door of his bedchamber opens; Charlotte
de Bavière, crimson in the face, appears. She calls
her people together, and hastily departs, followed by
the wondering glances of the courtiers, standing in
groups about the Œil de Bœuf.</p>

<p class="i1">The King, fearing that there was no chance of
overcoming the opposition of Madame, either by
persuasions or by threats, consulted Madam de Maintenon.
With characteristic duplicity, she advised
that what could not be done openly, must be brought
about by stratagem. She sent for the Abbé Dubois,
the <i>âme damnée</i> of the young Duke, his tutor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
his companion, and by promises of money and speedy
preferment she completely made him her own.
Dubois promised to hurry on the marriage with or
without the consent of Madame. The Duke, who
loved his mother, and respected her scruples, only
yielded when Dubois artfully presented to him the
certain loss of all influence, as well as the personal
animosity of the King, if he refused.</p>

<p class="i1">Philippe d'Orléans met Mademoiselle de Blois in
the apartment of Madame de Maintenon. The
marriage took place at Versailles.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i-310.jpg" id="i-310.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i-310.jpg"
        alt="" />
  <div class="caption">GASTON, DUKE OF ORLEANS.<br />
    <span class="smaller">FROM A STEEL ENGRAVING.</span></div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Madame was furious at what she termed her "dishonour."
She wept, abused, menaced, and scolded
by turns. But finding that there was no redress,
that the marriage was legal, and that further opposition
might arouse the vengeance of the King, she
gradually cooled down and received her new daughter-in-law
with tolerable civility; particularly as the
marriage with Mademoiselle de Blois continued the
possession of the Palais Royal, with all its pictures,
sculptures, and valuables, in the Orléans family, a
gift which somewhat served to gild the bitter pill
she was called on to swallow.</p>

<p class="i1">This marriage did not improve the Duke's conduct
or character. He was galled by what he had been
forced to do; his temper was soured; his excesses
increased. Nor was the Duchess of a disposition to
endear herself to any husband. Imperious, luxurious,
and bitter-tongued, she always forgot that her
mother, Madame de Montespan, was not the wife of
her father, and treated the Duke as her inferior. He
bore her extravagant pride, and listened to her
harangues, reproaches, and taunts (expressed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
real eloquence) in silence. Sometimes he called her
<i>Madame Lucifer</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">With such parents their children grew up in habits
of licentiousness, only equalled by the imperial
ladies of Old Rome.</p>

<p class="i1">The Duchesse de Berry—the eldest of the Regent's
daughters—kept her Court at the Luxembourg with
regal pomp. She received embassadors seated on a
throne, surmounted by a canopy sprinkled by the
lilies of France. But she did not think it beneath
her dignity to do the honours of certain <i>petits soupers</i>
at the Palais Royal—too well known to need further
mention here.</p>

<p class="i1">Her sister, Mademoiselle de Valois, was as remarkable
for her beauty as for her lack of virtue.</p>

<p class="i1">Mademoiselle d'Orléans—third daughter of the
Regent—was, if possible, more wanton than her
sisters. To the eternal disgrace of the Church she
was elected Abbess of Chelles. "<i>Tel père, tel fils</i>,"
says the proverb.</p>

<p class="ac">AT MARLY.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial-t.jpg"
    alt="Drop Cap T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is a lane on the heights over Paris, embowered
by wooded hedge-rows, or skirted by
open vineyards; this lane leads from Saint-Germain
to Marly.</p>

<p class="i1">Below the village, deep in a narrow gorge, is the
site of the once famous palace built by Louis XIV.
Trees now wave and cattle browse on turf where
once clustered twelve pavilions, linked together by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
arches and colonnades, in the Italian or villa style, to
suit the royal fancy of a summer retreat.</p>

<p class="i1">Not a stone has been left by the Revolution;
what were once gardens and a park, is now a secluded
meadow. Blue-bells, thyme, and primroses
carpet the mossy earth; and the thrush, the cuckoo,
and the early swallow carol among pale sprays of
beech and hazel. There are deep ditches and swampy
pools, once carp-ponds and lakes, part of a plaisance,
arranged in the solemn taste of that day, when nature
itself was cut and trimmed <i>à la Louis Quatorze</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">When Louis fixed upon Marly as a residence he
was tired of Versailles. He was old, he said, and
needed relaxation. He wanted a <i>folie</i>, a hermitage—<i>un
rien enfin</i>—where he could retire from the
crowd and the restraints of his Court, sleep three
nights in each week, and enjoy the society of his
especial favourites.</p>

<p class="i1">Either the King altered his plan, or his architect
(Le Nôtre) disregarded the royal instructions. Millions
were squandered on a residence, "which was to
cost nothing." A forest of full-grown trees was
brought from Compiègne. The expense of draining
the marshy soil, and elevating the waters of the Seine
into the <i>Machine de Marly</i>, was never acknowledged.</p>

<p class="i1">What a stiff, solemn tyrant Louis is become!
Selfish, exacting, pedantic, intolerant, dreaded by his
children and grand-children, and exercising over
them the most absolute control. Unhappy royal
family, how one pities them! Marly was a dreadful
infliction. Ill or well, they must go. The Duchess
de Bourgogne might plead her interesting situation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
and the positive prohibition of Fagon: no matter,
her name is on the list—she must go. The Duchesse
de Berry—that profligate daughter of the Duc
d'Orléans—is in her bed seriously ill: her mother,
the Duchesse d'Orléans, pleaded for her—in vain;
if she could not walk she must be carried—to Marly
she must go. She was dragged thither in a boat.</p>

<p class="i1">Madame de Maintenon herself dared to confess
to no ache or pain that availed to rescue her from
standing in the cold winds on frosty mornings—for
the King loved the open air, and did not fear weather—beside
him while he fed the fat carp in marble
basins, decided upon a fresh alley to be cut through
the woods, or upon a new cascade that was to pierce
the hills, or a larger pavilion to be added to those
already built.</p>

<p class="i1">Nothing could be a greater proof of favour than
to be included in the "list" to Marly. It was an
honour more craved for than a ribbon or a place at
Court. The names of the distinguished few were
written down in the King's own hand (a very bad
specimen of calligraphy), after due consultation with
Madame de Maintenon. She was fond of Marly,
hence its favour as a residence. She had herself
superintended the building, seated in her gilt sedan
chair, the King, hat in hand, standing by her side.
At Marly she could better isolate him than at Versailles.
His loneliness threw him more under her
influence and under that of the Duc de Maine. These
two, pupil and governess, perfectly understand each
other. There is to be a codicil to the royal will,
virtually passing over the Duc d'Orléans, his nephew,
to invest Maine with all the powers of a Regent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
Madame de Maintenon represents this hypocritical
son of De Montespan as a simple-hearted, unostentatious
man, wholly occupied by his attendance on
his Majesty and with his classical studies. The King,
whose personal activity is diminished, and whose
powers of mind are impaired, believes it. Louis,
once renowned as the finest horseman, sportsman,
runner, dancer, shot, and charioteer, driving four
horses with ease and grace, in France, is now stiff
and somewhat infirm. Too indolent to move about
and inquire for himself, he sees and hears only
through Madame de Maintenon. To others he is an
unbending autocrat.</p>

<p class="i1">If Louis is feared as a parent he is hated as a
Sovereign. The denunciations of his <i>ci-devant</i> Protestant
wife in the interests of his salvation lash him
into inexpressible terror of perdition. She suggests
that he can best expiate the excesses of his youth by
a holocaust to the Almighty of all the heretics within
his realm. The Jesuits press him solely. Terrified
by the threats of awful judgments upon impenitent
sovereigns, Louis signs the Revocation of the Edict
of Nantes. He expels the Jansenists, destroys their
pleasant refuge on a wooded hill near Maintenon,
accepts the Bull <i>Unigenitus</i>, exiles the Cardinal de
Noailles, and fills the state prisons with recusant
bishops.</p>

<p class="i1">The whole of France is in indescribable confusion.
The south, where the reformed faith prevails,
is deluged with blood. Many thousands of industrious
and orderly citizens doom themselves to perpetual
exile rather than abjure the Protestant faith.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Le Grand Monarque</i> is now a lonely, melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
old man. Defeat has dogged his armies; the elevation
of his grandchild, Philip, to the throne of Spain
has well-nigh brought France to destruction. Death
has been busy with his family: the Dauphin is dead;
his son, the Duc de Bourgogne, is dead; Adelaide
de Savoie, his wife, most justly dear to Louis, is
also dead; and now there only remains one little
life, their son, the infant Duc d'Anjou between himself
and the extinction of his direct line. The Court
at Marly is as lugubrious and austere as Madame de
Maintenon and the Jesuits can make it.</p>

<p class="i1">Yet a shadow of the pomp and etiquette of Versailles
is still kept up. On certain days after dinner,
which takes place at noon, his Majesty receives the
royal family. The folding doors of the royal suite
are thrown open, and Louis appears. His hat with
overtopping feathers is on his head, one hand is
placed upon the breast of his coat, the other rests
upon an ormolu table. He wears a diamond star;
and a blue ribbon is passed across his breast. His
coat is of black velvet, his waistcoat of red satin
richly wrought with gold; he wears diamonds in his
shoe-buckles and in his garters. On his head is a
ponderous black wig, raised high on the forehead.
This black wig gives his thin, hatchet-shaped face,
seamed with wrinkles, a ghastly look. Louis changes
his wigs many times each day to suit various occasions.
He has wigs for all emergencies. In figure
he is much shrunk, and is slightly bent. As he
stands, his hand resting on the table for support,
every movement is studied to impose silence and
awe. To the day of his death he is majestic, and
has the grandest manners in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The royal family, conducted through galleries and
colonnades lined with exotics and orange-trees (for
Louis loves orange-flowers, all other scents and
essences, however, are forbidden), pass before him.
They wear mantles or mantelets according to their
rank. To the obeisances of those who enjoy the
honour of the <i>fauteuil</i> his Majesty returns a decided
bow. Others who occupy <i>tabourets</i> only, receive
but a qualified acknowledgment. People who sit on
<i>pliants</i> are not received at Marly at all.</p>

<p class="i1">After the reception come the visits. Those who
by their rank are entitled to receive as well as to pay
visits, flutter backwards and forwards, with painful
activity. Madame la Duchesse or Madame la Princesse
rushes out of one door and in at another,
shouldering her train, to salute a royal personage
and return before more company arrive to visit herself.
Sometimes a call of ceremony is arranged to
Saint-Germain, situated about two miles from Marly,
where the unhappy James II. and his Queen, Mary
of Modena, reside, as annuitants on the royal
bounty. Here the question as to who should wear
mantles and who mantelets, who should have <i>fauteuils</i>
and who <i>tabourets</i>, complicates itself to such
an extent (the etiquette of the English Court having
also to be duly considered) that even his Majesty
grows embarrassed. He cuts the Gordian knot by
not sitting down at all. He exchanges a few casual
phrases with the exiled Stuarts <i>standing</i>, and forthwith
returns to the <i>rural retreat</i> of Marly.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON St. Louis day, 25th of August, 1715, the
King, then seventy-seven years old, felt
seriously indisposed. The disease from which he
suffered was at first called sciatica. On the 15th he
dined in his bedroom at one o'clock. Later he was
able to rise and was carried into the saloon of
Madame de Maintenon, where he met his ministers.
Next day he presided at the council of state held in
a room adjoining his bedroom. On the 25th he was
sensibly worse. On the 28th, in consequence of
fatal symptoms, his surgeon Maréchal proposed to
amputate his leg. The aged King scanned the surgeon's
face attentively.</p>

<p class="i1">"How long should I last then?" he asked.</p>

<p class="i1">Maréchal's hand was on Louis's wrist. His pulse
did not vary while he waited for an answer.</p>

<p class="i1">"In that case," returned Maréchal, "your Majesty
might hope to survive some days, perhaps some
weeks longer."</p>

<p class="i1">"Then it is not worth while," was the reply in a
steady voice. "How long can I live <i>now</i>, Maréchal?
Tell me the truth."</p>

<p class="i1">"Till Wednesday most probably, your Majesty."</p>

<p class="i1">"Ah! my death is to be on Wednesday. It is
well. It is not so hard to die as I had thought."</p>

<p class="i1">He said no more at that time. Madame de Maintenon
sat beside him. Père Letellier, his confessor,
and a Jesuit, hovered about his bed. In his hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
was a paper concerning the Bull <i>Unigenitus</i>, which
he urged the King to sign. So merciless was his
persistence, that the attendants drove him from the
room. The Duc de Maine, and his brother, the
Comte de Toulouse, watched. The royal will and
codicil, sealed with seven seals, making Maine virtually
Regent, was walled up until the King's death.
The parliament was known to be in favour of the
Duc d'Orléans. It was needful to be first in the
field. Maine never took his eyes off his father.
There lay that father, his prominent features sharpened
by approaching death, upon his bed, such as
we see it now, for no other monarch has lain in it
since; the tester and framework of dark wood, from
which gloomy satin curtains hang, carved and gilt,
and guarded by a <i>ruelle</i> or balustrade of gilded pillars,
which none dare pass. Upon his feet lay a
counterpane, worked by the pupils of Saint-Cyr.
On the walls, near enough for his eye to rest upon,
hung the portrait of his mother, Anne of Austria,
and two other pictures—St. John, by Raphael, and
David, by Domenichino. These pictures never left
him, even on his shortest journeys. On the mantelpiece,
near the bed, was a bust of his dead favourite,
Adelaide de Savoie.</p>

<p class="i1">At the King's desire, Madame de Ventadour
brought in the five-year old Duc d'Anjou, son of the
Duc de Bourgogne, his great-grandson and successor.
"Allow me to kiss him, madame," said
Louis, courteous to the last. The child was laid
upon the bed, and burst out crying. Madame de
Ventadour took him in her arms to comfort him.
"My child," said Louis, bending his dim eyes upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the rosy-cheeked boy, "you will soon be King over
a great people. Give thanks to God for all you possess.
Keep peace with your neighbours. I have
loved war too much. Do all that I have left undone."
Again and again he kissed the frightened
child, ere he would let him go.</p>

<p class="i1">Then he desired to speak with such nobles and
courtiers as waited without. "I die," he said, "in
the Catholic faith. I am myself ignorant of the
merits of the various schisms which divide it. I
have followed such advice as was given me. If I
have erred, my advisers alone are responsible, not
I. I call God to witness that what I say is true.
Gentlemen, I bid you all good-bye. Forget my bad
example. Pray for me."</p>

<p class="i1">Then the dying monarch turned his face towards
Madame de Maintenon, who was seated within the
<i>ruelle</i> of the bed. "Madame," he said in a low
voice, "I regret no one but you. I have not made
you happy." His voice hitherto firm, now faltered.
"But I have one consolation in leaving you," he
added, "we shall soon meet again." He tried to
look at her, but Madame de Maintenon turned from
him with disgust. She shuddered.</p>

<p class="i1">"What a rendezvous!" she muttered half aloud.
"He cares for no one but himself." Bolduc, the
King's apothecary, was near, and heard her say so.
That very day she left him while he dozed, and
drove away to Saint-Cyr.</p>

<p class="i1">On Sunday, the 1st of September, Louis died.
His confessor, the Jesuit Letellier, never returned.
Madame de Maintenon remained at Saint-Cyr. Save
the Cardinal de Rohan, and the parish priest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Versailles, all had forsaken him. No sooner had he
breathed his last, than precautions were necessary
to guard his body from insult.</p>

<p class="i1">While the first lord in waiting, standing at the
central window within the royal bedchamber which
overlooks the Cour de Marbre, the town of Versailles,
and the forest, broke his bâton of office, shouting in
a loud voice, "The King is dead! Long live the
King!" blasphemous songs and brutal jests passed
from group to group of low women gathered along
the streets.</p>

<p class="i1">When the funeral procession left Versailles, almost
secretly in the twilight, reaching the Bois de Boulogne
and the plain of Saint-Denis by tracks and
country roads, crowds followed it, bellowing horrible
imprecations. Along the causeway, outside the
barriers of Versailles, temporary tents were pitched,
where peasants stood, glass in hand, to toast the
corpse with curses. These peasants and the townsmen
of Versailles had heard of millions squandered
on royal mistresses, while the people starved; of
war abroad and persecutions at home; of intolerance
which spared no one; of ruin, exile, imprisonment,
and torture. The country people and the populace
did not acknowledge the dead as Louis the Great.
The citizens hated him. These men neither knew
nor cared that he had a sonorous voice, a measured
and solemn delivery that gave weight to his smallest
utterances, that leading a life of vice he observed
outward decorum, that he had a majestic presence
and a stately manner. These men weighed him—manners
against acts, life against words—and found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
him wanting. Posterity readjusted the scales and
pronounced them just. The great Revolution
declared the balance. Louis XVI. expiated the
crimes of his ancestors on the scaffold.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
